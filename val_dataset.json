However, several such reports de -\nscribe patients with features of both EBA and cicatricial pemphigoid.\nThe pemphigus group of disorders is most commonly \nassociated with thymoma and lymphoproliferative ma-lignancies. Patients with thymomas also often develop myasthenia gravis. The pemphigus course does not  \ncoincide with that of the neoplasm. However, careful re -\nview of chest X-ray findings may be prudent to ensure a possible thymoma is not missed. In the early 1990s, An -\nhalt and coworkers reported an entity that they termed \u201cparaneoplastic pemphigus\u201d (PNP). Patients with PNP develop severe mucosal erosions and ulcerations, poly -\nmorphic cutaneous lesions that may resemble erythema multiforme, and antibodies targeting a number of pro -\nteins, particularly desmoplakin, envoplakin, and peri -\nplakin (Fig. 17-4). However, several cases of lichenoid paraneoplastic pemphigus in patients treated with ritux-imab have been reported in which autoantibody detec -\ntion was delayed or antibodies were not identified. The term paraneoplastic autoimmune multiorgan syndrome (PAMS) has been proposed in order to reflect the mul -\ntiorgan system involvement now appreciated with PNP. Patients often also develop disease involving their bron -\nchi and may die of respiratory failure (see Chapter 16  \nfor further discussion of PNP/PAMS). The prognosis is poor, with very few survivors.\nDermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is associated with a \nrisk of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL), particularly enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma and B-cell NHL. In a recent meta-analysis, one in 2000 persons with gluten-sensitive enteropathy develops NHL each year. In DH patients who develop intestinal lymphoma, the removal of the tumor does not appear to affect the course of the cutaneous disease.\nPorphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) has been associated \nwith hepatic tumors, in particular with primary hepatoma. This association is most likely a coincidental phenomenon, as hepatitis C virus infection is a risk factor for both PCT and hepatic carcinoma. The exact frequency of hepatic tumors in patients with PCT is not known; however, there are reports of concurrent onset and a parallel disease course. Careful evaluation of the liver, including hepatitis C antibody testing, is advised in all patients with PCT.\nDermatomyositis and Other Collagen\u2013\nVascular Disorders\nAs discussed in Chapter 2, dermatomyositis (DM) is \nclearly associated with malignancy, which affects approx -\nimately one-quarter of patients with adult-onset DM; however, only rarely do patients with DM have a con-current onset and a parallel course of their tumors. The malignancy work-up of an adult with a new diagnosis of DM is reviewed in detail in Chapter 2, but goes beyond traditional age-appropriate evaluation. Women should be carefully evaluated for malignancy of the breast and gynecologic system. Ethnicity should also be considered: nasopharyngeal carcinoma was the most common malig -\nnancy in a study of DM in Taiwan. All patients should have a chest X-ray and probably a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, as well as a stool hematest. Malig -\nnancy risk appears to decrease with time from DM di -\nagnosis, but repeat examinations should be performed  \nannually for at least the first 3  years of the disease course, \nas malignancies such as ovarian cancer may not be eas -\nily detected by physical examination and imaging. At all times, unexplained symptoms or signs should be thor -\noughly evaluated.\nMalignancies appear to be a coincidental occurrence \nin patients with lupus erythematosus. Several reports of lymphoreticular malignancies in patients with systemic lu -\npus erythematosus likely reflect a complication of immu -\nnosuppressive therapy. Myeloma and  paraproteinemias \nhave been reported in patients with chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus, but the frequency and significance of these findings are not clear.\nAn increased risk of malignancy in patients with \nscleroderma has been confirmed in two recent meta-analyses. Increased risk of lung cancer, NHL, and other hematopoietic cancers was found.",

Patients with EM may have leukocytosis, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, elevated liver function test results, proteinuria, and occasionally hematuria.\nIn addition to the routine histopathologic examina -\ntion, a bedside evaluation of oral mucosal blisters may involve a Tzanck smear. In this preparation, a blister is unroofed, the base of the blister is scraped firmly, and the material obtained is placed on a glass slide and stained with Wright, Giemsa, or other suitable stain. EM blisters show only mixed inflammatory cells, but the acantholytic cells of pemphigus vulgaris or the multinucleate giant cells of herpes simplex infections can be excluded.\nA thorough history and physical examination should \nbe a prerequisite for the laboratory evaluation of the un-derlying causes of mucocutaneous disease. A careful drug history is particularly important. Obviously, suspected drugs should not be readministered, because of the risk of even more severe reactions. The signs and symptoms of infection must be sought. The history may suggest recent vaccination or hyposensitization as a precipitant.\nA high index of suspicion for HSV infection is particu-\nlarly relevant in recurrent EM. The diagnosis of HSV can be confirmed by Tzanck\u2019s preparation of an active vesicle, biopsy of a herpetic lesion, or culture of the virus from a herpetic lesion. Immunoperoxidase-labeled monoclonal antibodies and polymerase chain reaction are sensitive techniques that can substantiate the diagnosis of HSV infection. It is often difficult to distinguish the herpetic lesion from the EM lesion on mucosal surfaces, and it can be difficult to confirm HSV infection because of the time lag between HSV infection and onset of EM.\nIf other infections are suspected, appropriate imaging \nand laboratory studies can be ordered for confirmation. In particular, M. pneumoniae should be considered in cases of \nEM and SJS. A complete blood count, erythrocyte sedi -\nmentation rate, urinalysis, and liver function tests may be useful screening procedures in patients with EM, SJS, and TEN. Specialized tests (hepatitis serology; cultures for bacteria, fungi, and viral agents; syphilis serology; tuber -\nculin skin testing; antinuclear antibody profile; rheuma -\ntoid factor; pregnancy test; imaging for infection or occult malignancies) can be ordered as suggested by the history, physical examination, and screening tests.\nTreatment\nPatients with drug-induced SJS and TEN should wear a bracelet carrying a warning of their drug allergy because a second exposure may result in even more severe illness; given \nhttp://e-surg.com",

The condition may result in a coarse facial appearance resembling acromegaly. In ad -\ndition, the skin of the distal extremities is frequently involved. The palms and soles may also become hy -\nperkeratotic. Clubbing may occur without the other features of the syndrome, but has the same malignancy implications.\nThese disorders are most frequently associated with \nlung neoplasia. However, the changes are not exclu-sively paraneoplastic and may also occur in the setting of benign pulmonary and cardiac disease. The inci -\ndence of malignancy in patients with pachydermoperi-ostosis is unknown. Also, it is not clear whether tumor therapy affects the course of the skin or nail disease. Thus, clubbing with or without pachydermoperiostosis should be considered to be a sign of cardiopulmonary disease, and the possibility of lung cancer should be considered.\nTripe Palms\nTripe palms is a cutaneous paraneoplastic syndrome characterized by a thickened, moss-like, velvety texture of the palms ( Fig. 17-10). The appearance of the palmar \nsurface is similar to the intertriginous changes found in AN. Some patients with tripe palms also manifest AN, but the majority do not. Often, a malignancy is found concurrently with the recognition of the cutaneous dis-ease. Most of the associated cancers have been found in the stomach and lungs. In the absence of AN, tripe palms is most often associated with lung cancer. It is not known whether the cutaneous disease course parallels that of the malignancy.Vitiligo\nVitiligo or a vitiligo-like leukoderma has been reported in conjunction with malignant melanoma. Furthermore, \na report linked vitiligo in individuals over 40  years with \nvarious malignant neoplasms. This association has not been confirmed. In the authors\u2019 view, the onset of vitiligo in an adult warrants a full skin examination, including a Wood\u2019s light examination.\nHORMONE-SECRETING SYNDROMES\nCarcinoid Syndrome\nCarcinoid syndrome is produced by tumors that secrete \n5-hydroxytryptamine and other vasoactive amines. The tumors are most common in the gastrointestinal tract, but may also occur in the lungs or ovaries. Clinically, flushing, diarrhea, abdominal pain, wheezing, and occasionally shortness of breath occur. Tumors from the gastrointestinal tract do not produce symptoms until they metastasize to the liver because under normal circumstances, the liver is able to detoxify the amines responsible for the production of symptoms. Tumors in other locations are capable of producing symptoms prior to metastasis. The diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome is made by finding elevated levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (or other metabolites or vasoactive amines) in the urine. Removal of the tumor results in cessation of symptoms.\nEctopic Adrenocorticotropic Syndrome\nCertain tumors are capable of amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation and are therefore known as APUDomas. These tumors usually originate in the lungs (bronchial adenoma or oat cell carcinoma), gastrointestinal tract (carcinoid), or glandular tissues. Ectopic adrenocorti -\ncotropic hormone (ACTH)-producing tumors result in many of the typical signs and symptoms of Cushing\u2019s syndrome, with the exception of obesity. Intense hyper -\npigmentation is rare in Cushing\u2019s disease, but is common in patients with ectopic production of ACTH. The most common tumor that produces this syndrome is oat cell carcinoma of the lung.\nNecrolytic Migratory Erythema \n(Glucagonoma Syndrome)\nNecrolytic migratory erythema is an eruption strongly \nassociated with glucagon-producing pancreatic neo -\nplasms. The characteristic cutaneous eruption begins in the groin area as irregular erythematous patches stud-ded with superficial flaccid erosions, vesicles, and bul-lae. The erythema and bullous lesions may coalesce into circinate and/or polycyclic psoriasiform plaques.",

Presumably, the inflammatory infiltrate \nsurrounding the anagen hair bulb is related to the metabolic \nshutdown. Although the exact mechanism is unknown, per -\nhaps there is a release of cytokines that inhibit epithelial \ngrowth. The patchy hair loss seen in some systemic lupus \nerythematosus patients and the patchy or diffuse hair loss \nseen in secondary syphilis are other examples of inflamma -\ntory anagen arrest. However, it should be noted that anagen \narrest is only one of several mechanisms leading to hair loss \nin patients with systemic lupus erythematosus or syphilis.\nDiagnosis and Treatment\nAnagen arrest is a straightforward diagnosis with an ap -\npropriate history, extensive hair loss, and a hair pull test \nproductive of dystrophic anagen hairs demonstrating ta -\npered, pencil-point ends ( Fig. 43-6 ). Follicles demonstrate \na normal anagen to telogen ratio because of the abrupt on -\nset of anagen arrest. This is demonstrated histologically in \nhorizontal punch biopsy sections. Because hairs are rapidly \nshed over the course of only a few weeks in anagen arrest, \nif a cluster of hairs is forcibly plucked late in the course \nof shedding, virtually all of them will be telogen, as most \nof the anagen hairs have already shed ( Fig. 43-7 ). This is \nin contrast to telogen effluvium, where the telogen count rarely exceeds 50% and the remaining hairs are all normal \nanagen hairs.\nIdentification and treatment of the underlying cause of \nhair loss is key to the treatment of anagen arrest. Multiple \nstrategies have been attempted to reduce chemotherapy-\ninduced hair loss including application of a pressure cuff \naround the scalp and local hypothermia during the infu -\nsion of the medication. Use of a topical vasoconstrictor \nhas also been proposed. Each of these techniques is de -\nsigned to spare the scalp from exposure to the chemo -\ntherapeutic agent. It should be noted that because the \nscalp may act as a safe house for circulating malignant \ncells, patients with hematologic malignancies are usually \nnot candidates for these procedures. Topical minoxidil \nhas been used unsuccessfully in efforts to prevent che -\nmotherapy-induced alopecia; however, it seems to hasten \nregrowth once chemotherapy is complete. In most cases, \nalopecia due to anagen arrest is completely reversible; \nhowever, regrown hair sometimes demonstrates a differ -\nent color or texture than the hair that was lost. In addi -\ntion, certain chemotherapy regimens such as high-dose \nbusulfan and cyclophosphamide and high-dose radiation \nare increasingly reported to cause permanent alopecia.\nFIGURE 43-5  n Anagen arrest secondary to radiotherapy for an \nintracranial malignancy.

There is no association with either parity or \n gestation. Although familial clustering has been reported, \npersonal or family history of psoriasis is often absent.\nEpidermal, pinhead-sized, pustules are arranged in \ngroups or concentric rings at the periphery of erythema -\ntous, sometimes polycyclic, plaques. Over time, lesions \nevolve to yellow crusted plaques. IH initially affects the \nflexures and intertriginous areas with subsequent centri-\nfugal spread and generalization. The face, hands, and feet \nare typically spared. Pruritus is not usually prominent. \nOral mucosa may demonstrate circinate plaques or ero -\nsions. Subungual pustules may cause onycholysis and/or \nonychomadesis. Eruption onset is often accompanied by \nfever, chills, malaise, diarrhea, and vomiting, with poten -\ntial dehydration. Complications secondary to hypocalce -\nmia, including tetany, convulsions, and delirium, occur \nless frequently.\nCutaneous histopathology shows features of pustular \npsoriasis; parakeratosis and psoriasiform hyperplasia may \nbe observed. IF studies are negative. Laboratory abnor -\nmalities include leukocytosis with neutrophilia, elevated \nerythrocyte sedimentation rate, hypocalcemia, low se -\nrum vitamin D levels, and/or hypoparathyroidism. Blood \nand skin cultures are negative except in cases of bacterial \nsuperinfection.\nSystemic corticosteroids have historically been first-\nline treatment and are utilized at varying doses (initial \nprednisolone or prednisone 15 to 30 mg/day with in -\ncrease to 60 to 80 mg/day if needed); potential risks in -\nclude macrosomia, gestational diabetes, and premature \nrupture of membranes. In 2012, the Medical Board of \nthe National Psoriasis Foundation recommended cyclo -\nsporine (2 to 3 mg/kg/day) and infliximab as additional \nfirst-line agents for IH. Hypocalcemia must be prompt -\nly identified and corrected given the associated mor -\nbidities. Fluid management, vitamin D supplementation \nand treatment of bacterial superinfection should be un -\ndertaken. In severe cases, induction of labor or delivery \nvia Cesarean may be considered. Additional treatments \nfor recalcitrant IH postpartum include oral retinoids, \nmethotrexate, or PUVA (psoralen combined with ultra -\nviolet A), either as single agent or combination therapy; \nindividual medications should be evaluated for penetra -\ntion to breast milk in patients who are breastfeeding.\nHistorical case reports of IH indicated increased peri -\nnatal mortality from cardiac or renal failure or septice -\nmia. Such risks are currently uncommon, and maternal \nprognosis has improved dramatically with early  diagnosis, \nsupportive care, and aggressive treatment. Fetal risks  \nincluding intrauterine growth retardation, stillbirth, pre -\nmature birth, and fetal abnormalities are attributed to \nplacental insufficiency and have been reported even when \nthe disease was well controlled mandating intensive fetal \nmonitoring. IH typically resolves postpartum, but lesions \nmay persist for weeks. IH tends to recur in subsequent \npregnancy, often with earlier onset and greater severity; \nit may also recur with menses and hormonal contracep -\ntive use.",

Although the latter ectoparasite is part of \nthe normal inhabitants of the hair follicle, its presumed \npathogenetic role is based upon the numerous Demodex  \nmites found in the expressed follicular contents from \nAIDS patients with folliculitis in whom there was no \nother explanation for the folliculitis.\nPatients with AIDS can also present with cutaneous \nlesions due to systemic infections with parasites such as \nToxoplasma gondii  (primarily the central nervous system \n[CNS]), Acanthamoeba  spp. (primarily CNS and sinus -\nes), Strongyloides stercoralis  (primarily GI tract and lung), Leishmania  spp. (primarily bone marrow), and microspo -\nridia (primarily GI tract). Although these secondary cuta -\nneous lesions are rather unusual and do not have unique \nclinical presentations, the diagnosis can be made fairly \neasily by identification of the responsible organisms in \nbiopsy specimens.\nCutaneous Manifestations: Inflammatory\nThere are several inflammatory skin disorders that can \nserve as the initial clinical manifestation of HIV infec -\ntion, in particular seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, and \nreactive arthritis (the disorder previously referred to as \nReiter\u2019s syndrome\u2014see Chapter 7) ( Figs. 35-15 to 35-\n17). For some patients, this represents new-onset dis -\nease, whereas in others there is a flare of a preexisting \ndermatosis. In this particular clinical setting, seborrheic \ndermatitis, especially of the face, may be moderate to se -\nvere in intensity and the psoriasis rather extensive. Many \nyears ago, an increased number of Malassezia  organisms \n(yeasts that are part of the normal flora) were observed \nin HIV-infected patients with seborrheic dermatitis, \nand this observation contributed to the subsequent use \nof antifungal creams and shampoos for the treatment of \nthis disease, both in immunocompromised and immuno -\ncompetent hosts.\nFIGURE 35-14  n Annular erythematous scaly plaques of tinea cor -\nporis in an immunocompromised patient.\nA\nB\nFIGURE 35-15  n Seborrheic dermatitis characterized by scaling in \n(A) the nasolabial groove and ( B) the scalp in two patients with \nAIDS.

Patient comfort is improved by \nlocal anesthetic blocks of the lip. The response is usu -\nally favorable but temporary, and requires repeated \ninjections at intervals of months or years. Alternative \nanti-inflammatory medical treatment includes predni -\nsone, hydroxychloroquine sulfate (HCl ), sulfasalazine, \nmethotrexate, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- \u03b1 an-\ntagonists (antibodies not fusion protein). Surgical re -\nduction of the lips during a quiescent phase may correct \npersistent macrocheilia and improve function and ap -\npearance. Intralesional or systemic corticosteroids have \nbeen advocated to reduce the risk of recurrence after \nsurgical treatment.\nNECROTIZING ULCERATIVE GINGIVITIS\nNecrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (NUG; \u201ctrench mouth\u201d; \nVincent\u2019s infection) is a fairly common oral disease of \ncomplex cause that occurs in normal individuals. Con -\ntributing factors include the fusospirochetal oral flora, \nimmune deficiency, malnutrition, poor oral hygiene, \nsmoking, and psychologic stress. NUG occurs with in -\ncreased frequency in human immunodeficiency virus \n(HIV)-infected patients, in whom it may evolve rapidly \nto stomatitis, periodontitis, and osteitis if not adequately \ntreated. If the necrotizing infection extends to the facial \nskin, it is termed noma (cancrum oris). NUG (and oral \nhairy leukoplakia) are significantly correlated with helper \nT-cell depletion.\nThe chief complaint is usually painful bleeding gums. \nThe patient\u2019s breath is characteristically fetid, but it is \nthe presence of \u201cpunched-out\u201d ulcerated interdental \npapillae that helps to differentiate NUG from primary \nherpetic gingivostomatitis. Treatment consists of thor -\nough debridement of the involved tissue and cleaning of \nthe teeth by a dentist, followed by chlorhexidine rinses \nafter meals, and systemic antibiotics such as penicillin, \ntetracyclines, or metronidazole. In cases that are resis -\ntant to standard treatment, it is recommended to screen \nfor nonoral pathogenic enteric bacteria and Candida al -\nbicans  and to rule out infectious mononucleosis and HIV \ninfection.\nORAL PIGMENTATION\nThe most common form of oral hyperpigmentation is \nthat seen distributed symmetrically in darkly pigment -\ned individuals, although the intensity of the color is not \ndirectly related to that of the skin. Antimalarial therapy \nmay produce a bluish-gray discoloration of the palate \nafter long-term use. Bismuth therapy and lead intoxi -\ncation produce a narrow band of bluish-black pigment \nalong the marginal gingiva. Minocycline may discolor \nbone, fully developed teeth, and less commonly the oral \nmucosa. Cigarette smoking is associated with pigmen -\ntation of the lip and gingiva. Other causes of intraoral \nand cutaneous pigmentation include Addison\u2019s disease, hemochromatosis, and neurofibromatosis. Peutz\u2013 Jeghers \nsyndrome is a highly penetrant, autosomal dominant dis -\norder characterized by gastrointestinal hamartomatous \npolyps and pigmented macules around the mouth, lips, \nlabial and buccal mucosae, and dorsal and volar aspects \nof the hands and feet. The pigmentary markers of the \nsyndrome appear early in life allowing for the monitor -\ning of polyps for malignant transformation, which occurs \nin 2% to 3% of cases. Extraintestinal malignancies are \ncommon as well.\nXEROSTOMIA\nXerostomia is the subjective sensation of dry mouth \ncaused by a reduction in salivary flow. Patients with xe -\nrostomia can be recognized by their ever-present bottles \nof water or ice chips. A wooden tongue depressor often \nsticks fast to the dorsum of the tongue. Xerostomia is one \ncause of glossodynia or the burning mouth syndrome. \nDrugs with anticholinergic effects, such as antihista -\nmines and antidepressants, and diuretics may contribute \nto the problem.

Initial control with 3 to 4  mg/kg daily has been \nsuggested, but in the authors\u2019 estimation is associated with unnecessarily severe side effects. Because therapy may need to be continued for years, corticosteroid side effects become a major clinical problem. Corticosteroid sparing may be accomplished by the addition of an im -\nmunosuppressive agent, as discussed below. Immuno -\nsuppression is continued in sufficient doses to suppress blistering until serum antibody titers become negative, at which time tapering of therapy should be attempted. Follow-up biopsy for direct immunofluorescence once \nclinical manifestations have cleared for >6  months on \ntreatment can predict the likelihood of remission once medications are stopped. Ratnam and Pang showed that three-quarters of patients with negative direct immuno -\nfluorescence at this stage remain in remission, and those with negative direct immunofluorescence who do recur have mild disease. In contrast, all patients with a posi -\ntive follow-up direct immunofluorescence tend to relapse \nwithin 3  months of discontinuing therapy.\nSystemic methotrexate (oral, intravenous, or intramus -\ncular) can be used in dosages of 20 to 50  mg per week, but  \nmay aggravate oral ulcers. Cyclophosphamide is effective in \noral dosages of 1 to 3  mg/kg/day, and oral azathioprine may  \nbe used in dosages of 1 to 3  mg/kg/day. Mycophenolate  \nmofetil is effective alone or in combination with steroids \nin doses of 1 to 3  g/day. Close attention should be paid to a  \nvariety of potential side effects, including leukopenia, hepa -\ntotoxicity, teratogenesis, sterility, oral ulcers, and cystitis, depending on the specific agent used. Patients with exces -\nsive toxicity from oral corticosteroids or cyclophosphamide may have reduced side effects with monthly pulse doses.\nPlasmapheresis may be useful in pemphigus patients \npoorly controlled on conventional therapy. Six-liter ex -\nchanges on three separate occasions over a 3-week period are necessary to lower the antibody titer significantly. Immunosuppressants such as cyclophosphamide are then necessary to maintain the improvement and pre -\nvent the rebound of antibody levels that usually follows plasmapheresis.\nIntravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy is emerg -\ning as a promising treatment for many immune-  mediated \ndiseases. It works rapidly, and selectively lowers serum levels of pemphigus antibody. The clinical response in in -\ndividual patients is variable. The concurrent administra -\ntion of an immunosuppressive agent to prevent the syn -\nthesis of new antibody improves the efficacy. The dose \nis usually 2  g/kg/cycle, administered over 2 to 5  days. It \nis traditionally given in monthly cycles, but the optimal frequency of cycles is unknown.

It seems that either dosing schedule \nresults in a similar chance of response. Clinical improve -\nment usually occurs within days to weeks, indicating that mechanisms other than B-cell depletion may be active.

These viruses manifest in disease pri -\nmarily in immunocompromised hosts, resulting in  \nprogressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and \ngenitourinary tract disease, respectively. Two addition -\nal important manifestations of polyomaviruses include \ntrichodysplasia and Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). \nMost studies have reported a polyomavirus incidence of \n80% in MCC.\nClinical Manifestations\nAlthough JC and BK viruses are highly prevalent, clini -\ncal manifestations are rare in immunocompetent hosts. \nClinical manifestations generally occur with reactivation \nof the disease in immunocompromised hosts. Clinical \nmanifestations of PML include altered mental status, \nmotor deficits (hemiparesis or monoparesis), limb ataxia, \ngait ataxia, and visual symptoms including diplopia and \nhemianopia. BK virus commonly manifests as hemor -\nrhagic cystitis. Trichodysplasia-associated polyomavirus \nresults in erythematous to skin-colored spiny papules that \naffect the central face in addition to variable amounts of alopecia, especially affecting the eyebrows and eyelashes. \nMCC typically presents as a rapidly growing, painless, \nfirm, nontender, shiny, flesh-colored or bluish-red, intra -\ncutaneous nodule. It primarily affects white, elderly per -\nsons with a mean age at diagnosis of 76 years for women \nand 74 years for men.\nDiagnosis\nPolyomavirus is most often diagnosed after the primary \ninfection, which is usually asymptomatic in immunocom -\npetent hosts. There are many methods of diagnosis, of \nwhich serology looking for antibodies is commonly em -\nployed. PCR and urine cytology can also be used. Viral \nculture is rarely used outside of a research setting.\nViral-associated trichodysplasia (VAT) is diagnosed \nwith PCR and immunohistochemical staining. PCR \nidentifies the presence of human polyomavirus DNA, \nwhile immunohistochemical staining identifies the mid -\ndle T antigen of the human polyomavirus. It was initially \nthought that VAT was caused by a papillomavirus due \nto various features of initial stains. It was not until the \nidentification of the middle T antigen that VAT became \nassociated with human polyomavirus.\nBiopsy with histologic examination is required to \nmake the diagnosis of MCC.

In association with sebaceous neoplasms, keratoacanthomas are one of the cardinal features of Muir\u2013Torre syndrome, a variant of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) Lynch syndrome II. Additional sporadic cases describing an association between multiple keratoacanthomas and internal malignancy have been described.

The veins of the chest, abdomen, and lower extremities are involved either sequentially or simultaneously. The hypercoagulable state associated with cancer is probably multifactorial in origin, and may be induced by inflammatory cytokines, acute-phase reactants, circulating tissue factor, and can -\ncer microparticles. Patients with migratory thrombo -\nphlebitis without a known underlying cause should have a thorough evaluation, including a CT scan of the chest and abdomen.\nMulticentric Reticulohistiocytosis\nMulticentric reticulohistiocytosis (MRH) is a rare disorder characterized by polyarthritis and nodular cutaneous lesions. Oropharyngeal lesions, ocular in -\nvolvement, pulmonary effusions and fibrosis, peri -\ncardial effusions and myocardial disease, and hepatic, gastrointestinal tract and urogenital involvement may also occur. The cutaneous lesions are skin-colored to red or violaceous nodules on the scalp, ears, face, extremities, trunk, and mucous membranes. There is a known predilection for lesions to affect the hands, and the presence of multiple lesions at the nailfolds may give a characteristic \u201ccoral-bead\u201d appearance, which is considered pathognomonic for MRH (Fig. 17-7). The arthritis involves the joints of the hands and is destruc -\ntive, eventually resulting in severe deformities of the fingers. Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis has been associated with autoimmune disease (Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s, sys -\ntemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma), endocrine disease (diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease), and can -\ncer.

Breaks in the normal skin barrier due to tinea \ncan lead to superficial bacterial infections such as erysipelas \nand cellulitis, and even sepsis or fungemia. For this reason, \ntinea pedis should be promptly and aggressively treated.\nDM with debilitating ketosis increases the risk for \nlife-threatening mucormycosis ( Fig. 24-11 ). This occurs \nwhen various fungi of the Phycomycetes group produce \nan angiocentric necrotizing infection, particularly in \nthe nasopharyngeal area, that may lead to cerebral in -\nvolvement and death. Prompt intensive supportive care,  \nsurgical debridement, and intravenous therapy with am -\nphotericin B are required.\nBacterial Infections\nA polymicrobial etiology has been implicated in diabetic \nfoot infections. Care must be taken to separate infection \nfrom colonization. Gram-negative infections are three \ntimes more frequent in diabetic individuals than non -\ndiabetics. Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas \n aeruginosa  may cause severe tissue damage, sepsis, and \nlead to amputation. As such, these organisms should not \nbe regarded as insignificant in diabetic foot ulcers.

Pruritus can be a notable complaint in most patients, and severity is often based on the underlying pathology. Skin can be -\ncome lichenified when the pruritus is persistent, which is seen more often in patients with chronic skin condi-tions that subsequently worsen, such as atopic dermati -\ntis or CTCL. In general, there is sparing of the palms, soles, and mucous membranes, although keratoderma of the palms and soles can suggest CTCL or pityria -\nsis rubra pilaris. Alopecia, nail dystrophy, and ectropion can be associated with chronic erythroderma, and the presence of these should prompt clinicians to perform further evaluation.\nEVALUATION\nA careful and detailed history should be obtained, focus -\ning on a history of preexisting skin diseases, prior biopsies performed, new medications, increases or decreases in doses of medications, exposure to chemicals or other al-lergens, sun exposure, and other systemic symptoms such as fatigue, night sweats, or unintentional weight loss. In early erythroderma, the skin findings may be characteris-tic of the underlying skin disease, such as typical psoriatic or eczematous plaques (Fig. 14-1) or orange-red plaques with islands of sparing ( Fig. 14-2). Although pathology \nmay sometimes be nonspecific, a biopsy should be per -\nformed in all patients when the diagnosis is unclear as it may give clues to the underlying diagnosis. If lymph -\nadenopathy is present, lymph node sampling should be considered if the history, physical examination, and histo -\npathology do not provide clues to an underlying etiology, the lymphadenopathy does not resolve with treatment, or the patient does not respond to treatment as expected. Evaluation for systemic associations should be performed including a complete blood count, comprehensive met -\nabolic panel, and blood cultures. In cases in which the etiology remains unclear, additional workup including imaging, HIV testing, and repeat skin biopsy can also be considered. A potential algorithm for evaluation is pre -\nsented in Figure 14-5.\nHISTOPATHOLOGIC FINDINGS\nAlthough histopathology can be nonspecific, a biopsy or multiple biopsies should be performed in patients with new-onset erythroderma or rapidly evolving erythema as they may provide clues to an underlying etiology. Histo -\npathologic features of erythroderma depend on the un-derlying etiology as well as the duration of the eruption. Acute cases of erythroderma are more likely to demon -\nstrate spongiosis, papillary dermal edema, and a superfi-cial perivascular infiltrate, whereas chronic cases display more hyperkeratosis, psoriasiform hyperplasia, and a thickened papillary dermis.\nAdditional features may provide clues to the underly-\ning pathology. Patients with psoriatic erythroderma often have psoriasiform hyperplasia of the epidermis, a reduced or absent granular layer, and focal areas of parakeratosis. Patients with underlying atopic dermatitis often demon -\nstrate spongiosis and mixed perivascular inflammation in-cluding eosinophils. An infiltrate of atypical lymphocytes with cerebriform nuclei can be seen in erythrodermic CTCL; the presence of epidermotropism or Pautrier\u2019s microabscesses are also helpful clues. Unfortunately, with Sezary syndrome or blood involvement of CTCL, histopathology can be very nonspecific in the skin.  \nAlternating ortho- and parakeratosis in combination with psoriasiform hyperplasia can suggest a diagnosis of PRP. \nFIGURE 14-3  n Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis \n(AGEP): a pustular drug eruption causing erythroderma.

Women should have \na chest CT at least once during adulthood to evaluate \nthe rare risk of developing lymphangioleiomyomatosis. \nScreening for TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disor -\nders should occur with each follow-up visit. Other peri -\nodic studies should be based on the history and clinical \nfindings.\nGenetic Testing\nMolecular genetic testing is currently available for detec -\ntion of 75% to 80% of the mutations found in TSC1 or \nTSC2. Identification of a pathogenic mutation in TSC1 or \nTSC2 is an independent diagnostic criterion, sufficient for \nthe diagnosis of TSC. Gene testing is recommended for \ngenetic counseling purposes or when the diagnosis of TSC \nis suspected or in question but cannot be clinically con -\nfirmed. Genetic counseling is essential for adults with even \nminimal involvement from tuberous sclerosis, since their \nchildren may be severely affected. There is a 50% risk of an \naffected parent transmitting the disorder to their offspring. \nPrenatal testing can be performed in families with a known \nTSC mutation. A normal result does not exclude TSC as a \nsignificant fraction (10% to 25%) of TSC patients have no \nmutation identified by conventional genetic testing.\nTreatment\nTSC is a multisystem disorder requiring management by \nmultiple disciplines. TSC is a progressive disorder with \nindividual features emerging at different times. Neuro -\nlogic manifestations of TSC represent the leading cause \nof associated morbidity and mortality. Knowledge of \nthe functional relationship between TSC1/TSC2 and \nmTORC1 has led to important clinical advances in the \nuse of mTOR inhibitors for the treatment of several \nclinical manifestations of TSC, including cerebral subep -\nendymal giant cell astrocytoma, renal angiolipomas, and \npulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis.\nSeizures in TSC are difficult to treat with conventional \nantiepileptic medications. At least one-third of patients \ndevelop refractory epilepsy. Vigabatrin and adrenocorti -\ncotropin hormone have been recommended as first-line \ntherapies for infantile spasms. The exact mechanism of  \nvigabatrin is unclear. Studies show that vigabatrin inhibits \nthe mTOR pathway in mouse models. Simple partial or \ncomplex partial seizures are often treated with anticonvul -\nsants. Sirolimus (rapamycin) and everolimus (a rapamycin \nanalog) have successfully been used to treat renal angio -\nmyolipomas and SCGTs in studies in patients with TSC. \nSirolimus has also reduced the growth of LAM in some, \nbut not all, treated patients. Inhibition of the mTOR path -\nway with rapamycin or rapamycin analogs has been shown \nto be effective in murine models of TSC and has promis -\ning results regarding seizure control in patients with TSC. \nOngoing clinical trials are studying the effects of these \nmedications on other neurological complications.\nSurgical and medical therapy with mTOR inhibitors \nare the two main treatment options for extracutaneous hamartomas. Indications for surgery vary and the choice \nbetween surgical resection and medical therapy depends \non individual circumstances.\nPatients may request treatment of cutaneous lesions \nfor cosmetic reasons.

Although deaths are infrequent, the risk of death \nis greatest when there is renal, central nervous system, \nor pulmonary involvement.

When the \nACE level is markedly elevated, two to three times the \nupper limit of normal, sarcoidosis may be more likely. \nACE is not routinely reliable in monitoring disease activ -\nity, but may trend with granuloma burden in a subset of \npatients. Other blood levels, such as serum IL2 receptor \nor chitotriosidase, are investigational and are not widely \navailable or clinically practical in evaluating patients with \nsystemic sarcoidosis.\nCardiac Disease\nThe true incidence of cardiac involvement in sarcoidosis \nis not known. However, autopsy studies suggest that it is \nmore common than clinically apparent and frequently \nasymptomatic. Cardiac sarcoidosis can result in symptoms \nof congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, or conduction \ndefects. The most common symptom is sudden death. \nAppropriate screening for cardiac sarcoidosis is contro -\nversial and recommendations are rapidly changing. All \npatients should have a thorough review of symptoms and \nelectrocardiography; any abnormalities (including a his -\ntory of palpitations) likely warrant further testing, such \nas 24-hour Holter monitoring, echocardiogram, cardiac  \npositron emission tomography, magnetic resonance  \nimaging, or referral to a cardiologist.\nOther Clinical Manifestations  \nof Sarcoidosis\nAlmost any area of the body can be affected by sarcoid -\nosis. Granulomatous renal disease has been reported on \nseveral occasions, although renal impairment is more of -\nten due to persistent hypercalcemia and hypercalcuria. \nGastric granulomas, breast soft tissue granulomas, bone \nmarrow granulomas, spinal cord lesions, and gonadal \ngranulomas have also been reported.\nRelationship of Cutaneous Disease  \nto Systemic Disease\nMany studies detail the cutaneous disease in patients with \nsarcoidosis. Unfortunately, none of these studies used the \nsame methods, and many did not define the cutaneous le -\nsions adequately. However, a few generalizations can be \nmade. Patients with lupus pernio more frequently have \nsarcoidosis of the upper respiratory tract and lungs, as \nwell as possibly more bone involvement, than do patients \nwithout lupus pernio. Those patients with EN and bilat -\neral hilar lymphadenopathy (L\u00f6fgren\u2019s syndrome) have a \nself-limiting course and a good prognosis. In all cases of \ncutaneous sarcoidosis, patients require evaluation for sys -\ntemic involvement.\nHISTOPATHOLOGIC FINDINGS\nSarcoidosis is characterized by granulomas composed \nprincipally of epithelioid cells with an occasional gi -\nant cell and little or no caseation necrosis, with scant \nperigranulomatous lymphocytic inflammation. Inclu -\nsion bodies (Schaumann, Hamazalki\u2013Wasserman, and asteroid bodies) may be observed in varying numbers, but \nthese are not specific for sarcoidosis and may occur in \nother granulomatous conditions. The granulomas may \nremain seemingly unchanged for months or years, may \nresolve completely, or may undergo a fibrotic change. \nAlthough this is classically a dermal disease, epidermal \nchange has been demonstrated histologically (particularly \nin vulvar sarcoidosis, wherein transepidermal elimination \nof granulomas has been reported).\nThe histopathologic differential diagnosis includes \nother granulomatous diseases, which may be excluded by \nspecial stains (infectious granulomas) and/or examination \nfor foreign material (foreign body granulomas). Because \nnoncaseating granulomas are not specific for sarcoidosis, \nother conditions must be vigorously excluded before a \ndiagnosis of sarcoidosis can be confirmed. Thus, the di -\nagnosis is one of exclusion. Special stains of the histo -\npathologic specimens should include the acid-fast bacilli \nand Fite stain for mycobacteria, and periodic acid\u2013Schiff \nstain for fungal elements. In addition, examination for a \nforeign body reaction with at least polarized light should \nbe undertaken, although the presence of foreign mate -\nrial does not exclude the diagnosis, with refractile mate -\nrial reported in up to 25% of sarcoidosis skin biopsies. \nVarious neoplasms should be excluded, particularly lym -\nphomas, because there are occasional reports of sarcoidal \ntissue reactions occurring in nodes adjacent to neoplastic \nchange.",

Oral antihistamines, \nbland emollients, and topical corticosteroids can be \nused to treat pruritus.

However, damage to tis -\nsues may occur from maladaptive autoimmune processes \nwhere self-directed T-cells or antibody-producing B-\ncells are activated in disorders such as systemic lupus \nerythematosus. Alternatively, damage may be initiated \nby various germline-encoded innate immune receptors \nwith the absence of involvement of the adaptive immune \nsystem. The term \u201cautoinflammation\u201d has been coined \nfor this process. This chapter will outline the various \nsyndromes where dysregulation of innate immunity is \ncentral to their pathogenesis.\nMOLECULAR PRIMER\nVarious molecules that are recognized by cells of the \ninnate immune system mediate the initiation of host \nresponse to infection or tissue damage ( Fig. 8-1 ).  \nChiefly, these are called pathogen-associated molecular \npatterns (PAMPs), which recognize bacterial and viral \ncomponents, and danger-associated molecular patterns \n(DAMPs), which recognize signals related to cell death \nand toxins. PAMPs and DAMPs interact with pattern \nrecognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors and \nNod-like receptors (NLRs), which leads to downstream \ninflammation. This inflammation is predominantly \n mediated by the relatively recently described multimeric \nproteins called inflammasomes. Most autoinflammatory \nsyndromes have genetic mutations in these pathways \nthat lead to increased and inappropriate inflammasome \nactivity ( Table 8-1 ).CRYOPYRIN-ASSOCIATED PERIODIC \nSYNDROME\nCryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS) is the \npreferred diagnostic term for three originally separately \ndescribed syndromes: familial cold autoinflammatory \nsyndrome (FCAS), Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), \nand neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disorder \n (NOMID). In practice, the severity of clinical presenta -\ntion is observed as mild (FCAS), moderate (MWS), and \nsevere phenotypes.\nPathogenesis\nCAPS is an autosomal dominant inherited condition. It is \ncaused by \u201cgain-of-function\u201d mutations in NLRP3 , about \nhalf of patients have a family history of CAPS with the \nremainder representing spontaneous (new) mutations. \nNLRP3  encodes cryopyrin, which activates the NLRP3  \ninflammasome. The downstream effect of this is exces -\nsive production of the proinflammatory cytokine inter -\nleukin-1 (IL-1), which is responsible for the clinical man -\nifestations of CAPS.\nClinical Features\nCharacteristically, patients present with an urticarial \nrash in the neonatal period ( Fig. 8-2 ). This differs from \nchronic urticaria in a number of ways. The rash is present \nlifelong, tends not to be pruritic although patients may \ndescribe heat or tightness in affected skin, and has a cir -\ncadian rhythm with little or no rash in the morning with \nprogressive worsening as the day progresses. It is associ -\nated with constitutional symptoms, which include fever, \narthralgia, headache, myalgia, and conjunctival injection. \nMost patients will describe these inflammatory episodes \non a daily basis and furthermore may be precipitated or \nworsened by other factors like cold exposure. As the clini -\ncal severity advances patients may additionally have high-\ntone sensorineural hearing loss and systemic amyloidosis. \nThe most severely affected patients may have neurologi -\ncal symptoms from raised intracranial pressure result -\ning in neurological impairment and rapidly progressive \n deforming arthropathies.\nEvaluation\nSkin biopsy is helpful, as it tends to reveal a neutrophilic \ndermal infiltrate, which is perieccrine and perivascu -\nlar without evidence of vasculitis. Genetic evaluation \nmay reveal a germ-line mutation in NLRP3 , although CHAPTER 8\nAutoinflAmmAtory  SyndromeS\nKieron S.

The pilosebaceous glands may portray changes notable for decreased size, poorly differentiated sebocytes and ke -\nratinocytes, and an inflammatory cell infiltrate. However, these changes may also be seen in normal-appearing skin.\nThe pathogenesis is largely secondary to the direct in -\nhibition of EGFR leading to dysregulated keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation, as well as a cell-mediated  \ninflammatory response. Absence of a smoking history, younger age, male gender, and fair skin tone portend a greater risk for eruptions of higher severity. Prophylactic therapy is recommended and consists of oral doxycycline \n100 mg twice daily or minocycline 100  mg once daily, \nalong with topical hydrocortisone cream 1%, sunscreen, and a moisturizer. As an alternative, treatment may be ini -\ntiated at the onset of eruption and is based on the severity. A combination of topical and/or oral corticosteroids and antibiotics is usually employed. Severe eruptions (grade 3 or higher) often result in dose modifications or even ces-sation of treatment.\nClinicians should remain vigilant of the possibility of \nsecondary bacterial, viral, or fungal superinfections (ob -\nserved in 38% of patients), and promptly initiate appro -\npriate antimicrobial therapy. Telangiectases overlying the areas affected by the rash are late sequelae. Discon-tinuation of EGFRIs typically leads to resolution, but treatment with a pulsed-dye laser may improve cosmesis.\nXerosis usually manifests later than acneiform rash, typ -\nically after 4 to 6  weeks of treatment with an EGFRI, but  \naffects up to 100% of patients when treated for more than \n6 months. In severe cases, the skin may become erythema -\ntous, inflamed, and ichthyotic; painful fissuring of the skin that most commonly affects the distal tufts of fingers and toes, periungual skin, dorsal surface of the interphalangeal joints, and heels may be noted. The pruritus may be local -\nized (accompany the acneiform eruption) or generalized.\nHyperpigmentation is a late development during the \ncourse of treatment with EGFRIs (after 1 to 2  months),  \nand is mostly postinflammatory in nature, although cas -\nes of de novo hyperpigmentation have been reported. An African-American ethnicity and UV exposure are predisposing factors.

These include alopecia, dyspigmentation, hypertrichosis, trichomegaly (Fig. 18-5), and textural changes. The alopecia typically develops after several months of treatment with an EGFRI. Significant in -\nflammation and pustular lesions on the scalp may result in patchy hair loss, predominantly affecting the crown. Paradoxical darkening, thickening, or curling of hair on the face and extremities may be noted. Trichomeg-aly and curling of eyelashes are common and may re -\nsult in significant corneal inflammation (presenting as xerophthalmia, meibomitis, and squamous blepharitis), especially when the eyelash growth is directed toward the eye (trichiasis).

Glutamine residues within gliadin are absorbed into the lamina propria of the small intestine and deamidated by tissue transglutaminase (TG2). Deamidated gliadin then binds to the groove on dendritic antigen-presenting cells and the antigen is presented to T-helper cells. Plasma cells then produce IgA antibodies to multiple antigens, including gliadin, tissue transglutaminase, and epider -\nmal transglutaminase. Natural killer lymphocytes cause villous atrophy. Circulating IgA antibodies to TG2 and TG3 result from this process and are an index of the severity of the intestinal inflammatory response. These antibodies decrease with adherence to gluten restriction.\nThe cutaneous lesions are probably produced by the \nIgA present in dermal papillae in combination with the epidermal transglutaminase (TG3) antigen. The intestinal \n inflammatory process is important for the activation of neu -\ntrophils, which infiltrate into the dermal papillae where the IgA immune complexes reside. Degranulation of neutro -\nphils releases neutrophilic enzymes, which induce degrada -\ntion of the lamina lucida and a basement membrane blister.\nClinical Features\nThyroid disorders have been reported in many cas-es of DH.

In general, the \nbiologic effects of thyroid hormones require binding to \nspecific nuclear receptors with subsequent alteration of \ngene transcription and stimulation of messenger RNA \nsynthesis. It is postulated that, in addition to nuclear re -\nceptors, subcellular receptors exist in mitochondria and \nplasma membranes. It has been clearly demonstrated that \nthyroid activity directly affects oxygen consumption, pro -\ntein synthesis, mitosis, and the thickness of the epider -\nmis. Thyroid activity is also considered essential for the \nformation and growth of hair, and for sebum secretion. \nDermal effects are less well defined.\nThe impact of thyroid hormone activity on the in -\ntegument, however, is more notable during deficiency or \nexcess states than during normal physiologic processes. \nThe prevalence of hypothyroidism is 4.6% and that of \nhyperthyroidism is 1.3%, therefore, the clinician will \nfrequently observe these findings in practice. With sev -\neral important exceptions (discussed later), the majority of cutaneous changes accompanying thyroid disease are \nneither unique nor pathognomonic. However, in patients \nwith thyroid dysfunction, even such nonspecific cutane -\nous findings and associations often provide important \nclues that aid in the diagnosis of previously unsuspected \nthyroid disease. Finally, some syndromes with cutane -\nous or mucosal lesions are associated with an increased \nrisk for thyroid tumors (e.g., Cowden\u2019s disease, multi -\nple mucosal neuroma syndromes, Gardner\u2019s syndrome,  \nCarney\u2019s complex, and Werner\u2019s syndrome).\nThe thyroid gland, which weighs an average of 20 to \n25 g in adults, actively secretes thyroxine (T 4) and triiodo -\nthyronine (T 3) from the intraluminal thyroglobulin of its \nfollicular cells. The follicular cells are derived primarily \nfrom median midpharyngeal tissue during embryologic \ndevelopment. T 3 is more active than its precursor T 4. It \nis worth noting that about 80% of the T 3 produced daily \nactually results from hepatic and renal deiodination of \nT4, rather than from direct thyroid secretion. Thyroxine \nhas a lower metabolic clearance rate and longer serum \nhalf-life than T 3 because it binds more tightly to serum-  \nbinding proteins than does T 3. The half-life of T 3 is less \nthan a day, whereas the half-life of T 4 is about 7 days. \nFurthermore, although only 0.02% of the total plasma T 4 \nand 0.30% of the total plasma T 3 are free (i.e., not protein \nbound), the free forms both determine the thyroid \u201csta -\ntus\u201d and maintain the negative feedback regulatory sys -\ntem involving the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013thyroid axis.\nCalcitonin is secreted from thyroid parafollicular cells \n(C cells).

Clinically visible mucosal lesions are absent, even in advanced cases. Auto -\nantibodies in pemphigus foliaceus are directed predomi -\nnantly against desmoglein 1. Pemphigus herpetiformis is a morphologic variant of pemphigus vulgaris or pemphi-gus foliaceus that occurs as grouped vesicles.\nFogo selvagem is an endemic form of pemphigus fo-\nliaceus seen in Brazil. It occurs predominantly in children and young adults from poor rural areas. It is characterized by desquamation, erythroderma, and an intense burning in the sun-exposed skin, giving rise to the term fogo sel -\nvagem (\u201cwild fire\u201d in Portuguese). Histopathologically and immunopathologically it is indistinguishable from pemphigus foliaceus. Unlike other pemphigus variants, this condition can be seen in multiple members of a single family. There is an increased frequency of HLA-DRB1 haplotypes, DRB1*0404, 1402, 1406, and 1401. An en-vironmental \u201csecond hit\u201d is suspected but not identified. Because of the clustering of cases near rivers, Simulium \nblack flies have been suggested as a possible vector. IgM-anti-Dsg 1 is found in a majority of fogo selvagem pa -\ntients in their native environment, but is uncommon in patients with other pemphigus phenotypes and in fogo selvagem patients who move to more urban settings, fur -\nther supporting a recurrent environmental antigenic ex -\nposure in the pathogenesis of this disease.\nPemphigus erythematosus (Senear\u2013Usher\u2019s syndrome) \nrepresents a localized variant of pemphigus foliaceus characterized by erythematous lupus-like malar dermati -\ntis. Patients frequently manifest an abnormal antinuclear antibody test as well as the presence of pemphigus anti -\nbody. Direct immunofluorescence microscopy may show immunoglobulin and complement components along the basement membrane, as well as characteristic intercellular pemphigus antibody deposition. This disorder is believed to represent the coexistence of lupus erythematosus and pemphigus foliaceus.\nIgA pemphigus comprises a recently characterized \ngroup of IgA-mediated immunobullous diseases. This entity presents as vesicopustules with neutrophils and acantholysis, most commonly affecting the axillae and groin. Oral involvement is rare. IgA pemphigus is sub -\ndivided into two histologic types: the subcorneal pustular dermatosis type with blister formation subcorneally, and the intraepidermal neutrophilic type where blisters form throughout the epidermis. The IgA pemphigus antibodies in the subcorneal pustular dermatosis type recognize des -\nmocollin 1, whereas rare IgA pemphigus sera recognize desmoglein 1 and 3. The antigen in the intraepidermal neutrophilic form remains uncharacterized. Only 50% of patients have circulating autoantibody on indirect immu -\nnofluorescence. The subcorneal pustular dermatosis form is clinically indistinguishable from Snedden\u2013Wilkinson\u2019s disease and must be differentiated by immunofluores -\ncence studies. Rarely, either form of IgA pemphigus may exhibit concomitant expression of IgG autoantibodies\u2014so-called IgA/IgG pemphigus.\nPenicillamine and angiotensin-converting enzyme \n(ACE) inhibitor therapies have been associated with a variety of autoimmune disorders, including pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus. Pemphigus foliaceus accounts for 70% of the penicillamine-induced cases, and pemphigus vulgaris composes the remainder. The development of pemphigus may occur with a wide range of dosages and is often a late complication of therapy.

In addition, in patients with a known  \nunderlying cancer, skin metastasis may be the present -\ning symptom of extranodal disease, thus impacting therapeutic decisions.\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\nStudies regarding cutaneous metastases vary greatly in methodology (case reports, series, meta-analyses) and in the patient populations investigated (autopsies, cancer registries). Furthermore, some studies exclude particular cancers, such as melanoma or hematopoietic malignan -\ncies, while others exclude tumors with local extension or \ndirect invasion, including only local or distant  metastases. \nThe incidence of cutaneous metastases in the literature ranges from 0.2% to 10%. In a retrospective study of 7316 patients with carcinoma (excluding melanoma, leukemia, lymphoma, and sarcoma), 5% of patients \n developed cutaneous metastases. In the follow-up study \nof 4020 patients that included melanoma, 10% of patients had cutaneous metastases. The average age of patients with locally invasive and/or cutaneous metastases in one \nstudy was 62  years.\nSkin metastases were the presenting sign of an  i nternal \nmalignancy in 0.8% of patients, and were the  presenting  \nsign of extranodal metastatic disease in  patients with \na known underlying malignancy in 7.6% of patients (6.4% if melanoma was excluded).The most frequent neoplasm associated with cuta -\nneous metastases varies by study and inclusion of par -\nticular cancers. In most studies, breast cancer has the highest incidence of skin metastases. However, some studies include direct extension, while others include only local or distant metastases. In one series, metas -\ntasis occurred in 6.3% of patients with breast cancer and was the presenting sign in 3.5% of patients. In another study, skin involvement occurred in 23.9% of patients with breast cancer and was the presenting sign in 8% of patients. In patients who developed cutaneous infiltration or metastases after the diagnosis of breast cancer, it was a late finding, occurring an average of \n101 months after diagnosis. In another study of 1287  \npatients with internal malignancy, hematologic cancers were the most frequent source of cutaneous metastases, while in another that included melanoma (but excluded hematologic malignancies), melanoma was the most frequent. Cancers of the upper respiratory tract me -\ntastasized to the skin at a high incidence as well. Lung, colon, and rectal cancers uncommonly metastasize to the skin, but given the high prevalence of these cancers, they are a common cause of metastases. Cutaneous me -\ntastases are often the presenting sign in lung cancer, and it is proposed that this type of malignancy spreads more quickly to the skin than many other cancers. Based on gender, breast, colon, and ovarian cancer are the most common causes of cutaneous metastases in women, whereas lung and colon cancer are the most common causes in men. However, if melanoma is included, it has been reported to be the most frequent source of cu -\ntaneous metastases in men, and second in women (pre -\nceded by breast cancer). The primary malignancies for cutaneous metastases based on percentage and gender are shown in Table 19-1\n. Prostate  cancer has a very low  \nincidence of cutaneous metastases even with its high prevalence. Neuroblastoma and leukemia are the most frequent cause of cutaneous metastases in children. In neonates, leukemia, multisystem Langerhans cell his-tiocytosis, and neuroblastoma, in order of rank, were the most frequent cause of cutaneous metastases.\nPATHOGENESIS\nCutaneous metastases may result from hematogenous and lymphatic spread, direct tissue invasion, or iatrogenic implantation.

SJS was defined to involve less than 10% denudation of the to -\ntal body surface area. Although this is a widely accepted definition, other opinion suggests SJS diagnostic criteria based on clinical disease presentation rather than result -\ning percent of skin sloughing. The classification we favor suggests that SJS presents with (1) a prodrome of fever \nand malaise for 1  day to 2  weeks, (2) two or more sites \nof mucous membrane involvement, and (3) skin involve -\nment that may include characteristic true target lesions, targetoid lesions (with two zones of inflammation, such as central nonblanching redness surrounded by blanching erythema), or other monomorphic lesions that may prog -\nress to skin denudation that is indistinguishable from TEN (Fig. 11-3). This definition emphasizes present -\ning symptoms and mucosal involvement and is similar to the original case descriptions of Stevens and Johnson in 1922 and Thomas in 1950 where patients had prodromal symptoms, mucosal involvement that was often ocular and oral, and a generalized skin eruption. Mucosal lesions of SJS may affect the ocular conjunctivae ( Fig. 11-4), oral \ncavity (Fig. 11-5), vaginal mucosa or penis meatus, anal mucosa, and esophagus.

Whether lichen sclerosus truly falls along \nthe morphea spectrum ( Fig. 3-5 ) or is an associated con -\ndition requires further clarification.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnostic approach to morphea includes character -\nization of the extent and location of involvement as well \nas exclusion of other common morphea mimics or mor -\npheaform disorders ( Table 3-1 ). Morphea is generally a \nclinical diagnosis, and skin biopsy may not be required \nin typical cases. Morphea and SSc are indistinguish -\nable on biopsy. Skin biopsy may nevertheless be useful \nwhen atypical findings are present and/or to assess the \nseverity of active inflammation when considering treat -\nment options. Biopsy specimens from well-developed \nlesions should include underlying subcutaneous tissue \nand are square in appearance histologically (the so-\ncalled \u201csquare biopsy\u201d). The epidermis may be normal \nor atrophic, with thickened and densely packed collagen \nbundles in the dermis, atrophy or absence of the skin ap -\npendages, adnexal trapping, and replacement of the fat \ncells in the subcutaneous tissue by hyalinized collagen \nbundles. In the early inflammatory stages of morphea, \na predominantly lymphocytic infiltrate, with or without plasma cells, is seen in the dermis and superficial subcu -\ntaneous fat ( Fig. 3-6 ).\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThe differential diagnosis of morphea includes a number \nof morpheaform conditions or morphea mimics, some of \nthe most clinically relevant including radiation-induced \nmorphea, cutaneous malignancy, injection site reactions, \nand lipodermatosclerosis ( Table 3-1 ).\nRadiation-induced morphea may be a subtype of \u201ctrue\u201d \nmorphea triggered by radiation-related immunologic ab -\nerration in the affected skin. Radiation-induced morphea \ntypically presents within 1 year after completion of radia -\ntion treatment, though delayed presentations can occur. \nRadiation-induced morphea is most common in women \nfollowing radiation for breast cancer, where it presents \nwith shrinkage of the affected breast, distinguishing it \nfrom radiation dermatitis. In this clinical scenario, biopsy \nis indicated to rule out recurrent malignancy, primary \nmalignancy (e.g., basal cell carcinoma), and metastatic \ndisease (e.g., carcinoma en cuirasse).\nInjection-site reactions and lipodermatosclerosis \nmay also mimic morphea. Cutaneous sclerosis at injec -\ntion sites has been reported with vitamin B 12 and vita -\nmin K injections, vaccinations, and other injectables. \nLesions tend to slowly resolve without treatment. \nLipodermatosclerosis, or sclerosing panniculitis, is a \nmanifestation of venous insufficiency identifiable by its \ntypical features of induration and hyperpigmentation \nalong the lower medial aspect of the leg, with a clas -\nsic \u201cinverted champagne bottle\u201d appearance.

Further work is needed to delineate the exact relationship of these cutaneous disorders with their potentially associated internal neoplasms. Epidemiologic studies are needed to further evaluate many of the syndromes that may be malignancy related.\nSUGGESTED READINGS\nAbreu Velez A M, Howard M S.

Usually, these result from vasculiti -\ndes that affect both medium-sized and small vessels, such as GPA, lupus, or rheumatoid vasculitis, and some types of polyarteritis nodosa. However, when such a clinical picture is caused by small-vessel involvement alone, it strongly suggests an IgA-predominant leu -\nkocytoclastic vasculitis or cryoglobulin-immune com -\nplex vasculitis. Many such patients have multisystem disease, and prolonged or recurrent courses and ulcer -\nations may be more likely in adults. In this setting, the early lesions tend to be classic palpable purpura, with a strong tendency toward the linking of lesions in a livedoid pattern, creating some confluent areas of epi -\ndermal or dermal necrosis.\nNoninflammatory vascular hemorrhage can occa -\nsionally occur as a result of defects in the vascular wall, but such hemorrhage is typically ecchymotic and non -\npalpable. The purpura resulting from vessel infiltration in light chain-related systemic amyloidosis is a good ex -\nample. Because the collagen and elastin content of very small blood vessels is minimal, cutaneous hemorrhage in association with the Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome or pseu -\ndoxanthoma elasticum is usually not the result of a vessel wall abnormality, but rather of poor vessel wall support by the surrounding connective tissue. The Kasabach\u2013Merritt syndrome, usually seen in infants, occurs with cutaneous or visceral vascular growths of either tufted angioma or Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma. These trigger platelet consumption and thrombosis; a clinical picture mimicking disseminated intravascular coagula -\ntion may result.\nExtravascular Causes\nExtravascular causes of hemorrhage may include ei -\nther major trauma or minor trauma to the skin. Major \ntrauma results in hemorrhage even in normal skin, is associated with remembered injury, significant tissue swelling, tenderness, or obvious abrasions, and is sel -\ndom a diagnostic problem. Purpura related to minor trauma may occur in the absence of obvious tissue swelling and often without the patient\u2019s recollection of trauma. Such hemorrhage is usually the result of poor support of the small blood vessels by surrounding ab -\nnormal connective tissue. The areas of skin most likely to be traumatized include the extensor surface of the forearms, the anterior lower legs, and the dorsum of the hands. Purpura that is caused in part by external trauma tends to be distributed in a geometric pattern, e.g., linearly on the forearm in a scraping injury, or linearly across a periarticular flexural crease. Perhaps the most common type of minor trauma-related pur-pura is actinic purpura. Most senile purpura should be classified as actinic or solar, because it occurs only in chronically sun-exposed areas with actinic degenera -\ntion of the dermis. Corticosteroid excess (endogenous or iatrogenic) is another common cause of poor dermal tissue vascular support (Fig. 15-6).\nThe presence of perifollicular hemorrhage should sug-\ngest the diagnosis of scurvy and requires a nutrition-di -\nrected history to exclude scurvy as a cause ( Fig. 15-7). The \nreason for the initial perifollicular localization of vitamin C deficiency is not known. The hemorrhage is probably caused by a collagen defect, because ascorbic acid is a nec -\nessary factor for the formation of normal collagen. Light chain-related systemic amyloidosis is a rare but impor -\ntant cause of dramatic minor trauma-  related hemorrhage, \nFIGURE 15-5  n Purpura fulminans following a varicella infection.

Frequently, these nodules are located on the lower limbs, although involvement on the arms and trunk may be also seen. Acute superficial thrombophlebitis of the superficial veins of the antero -\nlateral thoraco-abdominal wall is known as Mondor\u2019s disease. The term migratory is applied to describe this disorder because some lesions regress at the same time that new foci of thrombosis develop along the involved vein. Although a hypercoagulable stage, either primary or secondary, should be investigated, venous insuffi -\nciency of the lower extremities is the only precipitating factor in most cases. Classically, emphasis is placed on the paraneoplastic character of SMT; however, an inter -\nnal malignancy is seldom associated. Patients with Beh -\n\u00e7et\u2019s syndrome may also present with SMT of the lower extremities.\nHistopathologically, cutaneous lesions of SMT \ninvolve large veins of the septa in the upper subcuta -\nneous tissue, with luminal thrombosis and inflamma -\ntory infiltrates within the vessel wall. In early lesions, the inflammatory cell infiltrate is mostly composed of neutrophils, whereas in later stages lymphocytes, his -\ntiocytes, and occasional multinucleated giant cells are present. Granulomatous inflammation contributes to recanalization of the thrombus. A striking feature is that, despite the intense damage of the involved vein, there is little or no involvement of the adjacent fat lob -\nule, and the process is more vasculitic than panniculitic in nature.\nOnce malignancy has been ruled out and identification \nand correction of any underlying hypercoagulable state has been performed, treatment of SMT is conservative, with bed rest, analgesics, and the use of a compression stocking or bandage on the involved leg. In chronic or recurrent cases, especially those associated with malig -\nnancy, heparin and fibrinolytic therapies may be used.\nPREDOMINANTLY LOBULAR \nPANNICULITIS\nErythema Induratum of Bazin/Nodular \nVasculitis\nErythema induratum (EI) and nodular vasculitis have \ngenerally been considered to be synonyms referring to a clinicopathologic entity with several possible causes, one of which is tuberculosis. In some geographic areas, re -\ncent polymerase chain reaction investigations have dem-onstrated that Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA is present \nin most cutaneous biopsy specimens of patients with EI, supporting the notion that tuberculosis is the most important etiologic factor for this type of panniculitis. However, there are some clinicians who prefer to use the term nodular vasculitis when referring to individuals with a nontuberculous etiology. Nontuberculous cases have been reported to be related to other infectious agents (e.g., Nocardia) or to drugs (e.g., propylthiouracil).\nEI shows an overwhelming female predominance, \nwith a mean age of presentation between 30 and 40  years. \nClinically, EI is characterized by tender, erythematous to violaceous nodules and plaques that most often develop on the lower legs, especially the calves. Lesions are per-sistent, tend to ulcerate, heal with scarring, and are prone to recurrence.\nOn histopathology, EI is generally described as a pre-\ndominantly lobular or mixed septal/lobular panniculitis. Inflammation is mixed, and can include neutrophils, lym -\nphocytes, macrophages, and multinucleated giant cells. Vasculitis is identifiable in the vast majority of cases, and most frequently involves small venules of the fat lobules and, less frequently, veins or arteries of the connective tissue septa. Necrosis, with a coagulative or caseous ap -\npearance, has been described in both tuberculous and nontuberculous cases, but the incidence and degree of necrosis are greater in cases related to M. tuberculosis.\nSpontaneous regression may occur in a large per -\ncentage of cases of EI, making evaluation of response to therapy challenging.",

Be Aware of \nPharmacogenomics Biomarkers \nRequired to Assess Drug Safety for \nIndividual Patients\nPharmacogenomics plays an important role in identi -\nfying patients at risk for specific adverse events and in \nidentifying potential nonresponders. Two examples of \nimportant pharmacogenomics tests in dermatology are \nglucose-6-phosphodehydrogenase (G6PD) level to as -\nsess for G6PD deficiency in patients prescribed dapsone, \nand thiopurine methyltransferase testing to assess for \n intermediate or poor metabolizers in patients prescribed \nazathioprine (see the FDA website listed in Suggested \nReadings for available pharmacogenomics biomarkers).\nPrinciple 7. Be Cognizant of Important \nDrug\u2013Drug Interactions when \nPrescribing Systemic Therapy for \nCutaneous Diseases\nAn increasing number of patients who present to the der -\nmatologist are already receiving a wide variety of systemic \nmedications for nondermatologic medical problems. An \nawareness of the patient\u2019s complete medication profile helps \nenhance the safety of prescribing systemic drugs, particularly \nfor patients who are receiving cyclosporine or  methotrexate. \nA systematic way of recording and updating the patient\u2019s \ncomplete medication profile helps minimize the risk of these \npotential interactions. It is our suggestion that current drug \ntherapy be monitored and recorded at each patient visit. \nElectronic medical records have helped decrease the risk \nof drug\u2013drug interactions by alerting  physicians to poten -\ntial interactions between medications prescribed and those \nrecorded in the chart. This should not replace an effort on \nthe part of the dermatologist to be alert to potential drug\u2013\ndrug interactions when prescribing systemic medications. It \nis also important to notify the patient of key interactions and \nmedications to avoid during therapy.\nMONITORING PRINCIPLES\nPrinciple 1. Informed Consent Is a \nCommunication Process and Not \nMerely a Signature on a Piece of Paper. \nAppropriately Thorough Informed \nConsent Is an Essential Step toward the \nSafe Use of Systemic Drugs\nThere is an important medicolegal basis for informed \nconsent. This communication is usually documented by \nnoting that the patient is aware of the risks, benefits, and \nalternatives to the proposed therapy. Generally, chart documentation of this discussion by the physician is suf -\nficient. Experimental protocols require a signed consent \nform. In addition, consent forms for the use of isotreti -\nnoin in both men and women as part of the iPledge pro -\ngram are mandated by the FDA.\nThe medical basis for the informed consent commu -\nnication process is even more important. This discussion \nenables the patient to be more aware of specific areas of \nrisk and the patient\u2019s role in reporting important signs \nand symptoms. Occasionally, a patient decides not to use \na specific drug after learning about the risks. This is prob -\nably preferable to treating a patient who continually fo -\ncuses on the potential risks of therapy, however remote.\nPrinciple 2. A Patient Information \nHandout Specific to the Drug Being \nPrescribed Can Be an Important \nMeasure to Reinforce All Aspects of the \nMonitoring Process\nA patient information handout should reinforce all ele -\nments of the informed consent process described earlier. \nMore importantly, a clear listing of the signs and symp -\ntoms the patient should report allows the patient to know \nwhen to be concerned regarding problems that may arise \nlater in therapy.

Immunofluorescent-negative \ncases may represent a technical problem with obtain-\ning adequate tissue from mucosal surfaces such as the eye. However, it is important to obtain positive direct immunofluorescence results, even if multiple biopsies are required, in order to separate the disorder from pemphigus, lichen planus, and cicatrizing conjunctivitis secondary to irritants and allergens. Indirect immuno -\nfluorescence studies reveal circulating anti-BMZ anti -\nbodies of IgG or IgA class in less than 50% of cases. Antibodies in cicatricial pemphigoid recognize several BMZ molecules, including BPAG1 and -2, laminin 332, \u03b16\u03b24 integrin, and type VII collagen. The scarring na -\nture of this disease may be explained by the fact that the BPAG2 antibodies in cicatricial pemphigoid recog-nize the distal extracellular domain (carboxy terminus) of this molecule, which ends in the lamina densa, in contrast to classic BP patients where the more proximal NC16A domain of BPAG2 is targeted.\nA specific localized scarring variant of cicatricial pem -\nphigoid has been termed the Brunsting\u2013Perry type. In this variant, scarring and blister formation occur on the head and neck without concomitant oral involvement. The pathogenesis of cicatricial pemphigoid is believed to \nbe similar to that of BP, although the reason for localized \ndisease and scarring is not understood.\nThere have been numerous evaluations of the associa -\ntion between BP and internal malignancy. BP has been reported in association with malignancies of the lympho-reticular system, skin, lung, breast, pancreas, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract. However, rarely have concurrent onset or a parallel course been documented. Ahmed and coworkers, as well as Stone and Schroeter, were able to find no increased rate of malignancy in their BP patients, \nbut a study by Chorzelski et  al. did claim a 10% asso -\nciation. Most authors have concluded that there is no increased incidence of malignancy in BP patients com-pared to age-matched controls. Thus, BP is best consid-ered not to be a cutaneous marker of internal malignancy. However, recent evaluation of a subset of 35 cicatricial pemphigoid patients who had IgG serum antibodies di -\nrected against laminin 332 found that 10 patients had an associated malignancy.\nThis finding gives further credence to the need to \ncharacterize individual patients\u2019 antigen-binding profiles. Testing for specific antigen binding is only available in research laboratories at present, but indirect immunoflu -\norescence on basement membrane split skin is a standard technique in immunopathology laboratories, and can suggest the presence of antibodies to laminin 332 on the basis of the uncommon dermal binding pattern.\nBP has been reported in association with a wide vari -\nety of other disorders, including psoriasis, diabetes melli -\ntus, lupus erythematosus, pernicious anemia, thyroiditis, polymyositis, and rheumatoid arthritis. It seems unlikely that any of these associations is important in pathogen -\nesis, but the reasons for the associations remain unclear. In a case\u2013control study in 1984 Chuang and associates found 20% of BP patients had diabetes, compared to 2.5% of controls. This association remained significant even after correcting for age differences. The association with rheumatoid arthritis seems to be significant, and it has been hypothesized that the two disorders may share similar pathogenetic mechanisms.\nLichen planus pemphigoides has been described on \nmany occasions. It is characterized by the typical outbreak of lichen planus followed by a bullous eruption with the histological and immunopathological findings of BP. It is unclear whether these patients have coexistent lichen pla -\nnus and BP, or whether this is a distinct entity in which the inflammatory process of lichen planus stimulates an immune response to BP antigens.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThe initial diagnostic approach to blistering disorders is reviewed under the differential diagnosis of pemphigus. If biopsy suggests that the blister is subepidermal, direct immunofluorescence microscopy of perilesional tissue is indicated. BP characteristically demonstrates linear de -\nposition of IgG along the basement membrane.",

Symptoms require a four- to fivefold increase in blood vis -\ncosity, usually associated with >3  g/dL IgM (or >15  g/dL  \nIgG, >4 to 5  g/dL polymerized IgG3, >10 to 11  g/dL IgA, \n>6 to 7  g/dL polymerized IgA) and can also be seen with \nchylomicronemia syndrome, and with cellular causes of hyperviscosity in polycythemia vera, sickle cell disease, leukemia, and spherocytosis. Hyperviscosity alone may not fully explain the increased bleeding tendency in these patients. Additional factors in some patients are antibody activity against clotting factors, platelet dysfunction as a result of surface coating by immunoglobulin, and other poorly understood clotting defects.\nCold Agglutinin Disease\nCold agglutinin disease is characterized clinically by epi-\nsodes of hemolytic anemia, hemoglobinuria, and cold-mediated vaso-occlusive phenomena. Patients may develop acrocyanosis, Raynaud\u2019s-like phenomenon, or generalized livedo reticularis, but cutaneous ulcerations or necrosis are unusual. Jaundice or pallor may follow a severe episode of hemolysis. Cold agglutinin disease occurs in two forms: primary (idiopathic) and secondary. Patients with primary cold agglutinin disease may develop features diagnostic of Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s macroglobulinemia, whereas secondary forms follow certain infections. Cold agglutinins can also be categorized by their red cell antigen affinity. The antibod -\nies are usually directed against the I/i antigen system, and, rarely, against Pr group antigens. Anti-I antibodies occur primarily in association with idiopathic disease, Mycoplasma  \npneumonia, and some lymphomas; anti-i-specific antibod -\nies are associated with infectious mononucleosis and some lymphomas. The cold agglutinins are monoclonal in pri -\nmary and lymphoma-associated disease and polyclonal in postinfectious disease. The rare cases of IgA cold agglutinin disease are also characterized by red cell agglutination in the microvasculature, but hemolytic anemia does not de -\nvelop because the cell-bound IgA does not fix complement.\nWaldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s Macroglobulinemia\nThis is a disease characterized by a serum monoclonal \nIgM spike and by malignant lymphoplasmacytoid prolife -\nration, primarily in the bone marrow, liver, spleen, and \nlymph nodes. In some patients the IgM paraprotein may behave as a monoclonal (type I) cryoglobulin or a cold agglutinin. Urticarial vasculitis associated with an IgM monoclonal protein, bone pain with hyperostosis, and \n intermittent fever is known as Schnitzler syndrome.\nCryofibrinogenemia\nCryofibrinogen is a plasma complex of fibrin, fibrinogen, \nand fibronectin that can precipitate on cooling and clot when combined with thrombin. Cryofibrinogenemia occurs as a primary disorder, or as an associated disor-der in patients with neoplasia, acute infections, collagen vascular disorders, or thromboembolic disease. Patients with cryofibrinogenemia may present with recurrent painful cutaneous ulcerations of the lower leg and foot. Purpura, often nonpalpable, may accompany the ulcers, which are usually small. The ulcerations heal with ivory stellate scars, resembling the cutaneous features of live -\ndoid  vasculopathy ( Fig. 21-2).\nDifferential Diagnosis\nIn cases of mixed cryoglobulinemia presenting as leuko-\ncytoclastic vasculitis, the differential diagnosis primarily \nincludes other necrotizing vasculitides. Hyperviscosity syndrome is usually caused by a clonal lymphoprolifera-tive disorder, but it can result from other hematologic disorders, such as polycythemia vera.",

Hyperferritinemia, elevated \nacute-phase reactants, and elevated liver function tests \nhave been noted. The natural progression of the disease \ncan be limited to one or multiple flares of systemic and \njoint complaints that resolve over the course of months \nto 2 years. Those with a persistent polyarthritis can have \na chronic form of the disease that can result in disability.\nTreatment\nThe mainstay of RA therapy is the early institution of \ndisease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), even \nin those with early disease. Methotrexate is often the \nfirst-line treatment utilized as a monotherapy for those \nwith mild disease, and in combination therapy for those \nwith moderate to severe disease with poor prognostic fea -\ntures. Other frequently used treatments include so-called \n\u201ctriple therapy\u201d consisting of concurrent hydroxychloro -\nquine, sulfasalazine and methotrexate, and inhibitors of \npyrimidine synthesis (leflunomide). Systemic corticoste -\nroids are often given for short intervals for control of dis -\nease flares, but are also sometimes used chronically in low \ndoses. Biologic therapies include those that inhibit TNF-\n\u03b1 (e.g., etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab, golimumab, \ncertolizumab), those that modulate T-cell activation \n(abatacept), inhibitors of IL-6 (tocilizumab), inhibitors of \ntype I receptors of IL-1 (anakinra), inhibitors of specific \nJAK kinases (tofacitinib), and agents that affect B-cell ac -\ntivation (rituximab). No controlled studies have been per -\nformed to assess the benefit of RA therapies in treating \nthe cutaneous manifestations of the disease. Rheumatoid \nnodules develop insidiously and are usually persistent, \nbut may regress spontaneously. Larger and/or symptom -\natic nodules can be treated with excision, but have a high \nrate of recurrence. Intralesional corticosteroids can de -\ncrease the size of the nodules; however, response is often \ntemporary. Eruptive rheumatoid nodules tend to regress \nwith discontinuation of methotrexate. Rheumatoid vas -\nculitis should be viewed as an extra- articular manifesta -\ntion of RA that dictates more aggressive control of the \nunderlying disease.\nRecent guidelines by the American College of Rheu -\nmatology recommend treatment with DMARDs for chil -\ndren and adolescents with Still\u2019s disease who are not well \ncontrolled with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs \nor intra-articular corticosteroid injections. Sulfasalazine \nshould be avoided in this population as it can induce \nmacrophage activating syndrome. Skin manifestations of \nStill\u2019s disease often improve with treatment of the under -\nlying disease.\nINTERSTITIAL GRANULOMATOUS \nDERMATITIS\nInterstitial granulomatous dermatitis (IGD) is a rare, \npolymorphous disorder first described by Ackerman \nin 1993. Some authors believe that it exists along a \nclinical disease spectrum with palisaded neutrophilic granulomatous dermatitis (PNGD); however, many of \nthe clinical and histologic features are distinctive. The \nunderlying etiology of IGD is unknown, but it is hy -\npothesized to be secondary to immune complex deposi -\ntion given its well-known association with autoimmune \nand connective tissue disorders, most notably RA, lupus \nerythematosus, autoimmune thyroiditis, vitiligo, diabetes \nmellitus, and autoimmune hepatitis. Malignancies have \nalso been reported to be associated with IGD, includ -\ning both lymphoproliferative disorders and solid organ \ntumors. Those affected by IGD are most commonly mid -\ndle-aged females, and can have arthritis symptoms prior \nto, concurrent with, or subsequent to development of the \ncutaneous manifestations.\nClinical Manifestations\nIGD typically presents with symmetric erythematous \npapules and plaques, often with an annular configuration, \non the lateral trunk, medial thighs, and buttocks.

The lesions are \nrarely found in infancy and become more common after  \npuberty, reaching a peak prevalence of 70% to 80% of cases \nof tuberous sclerosis. The Shagreen patch, however, differs \nneither clinically nor histopathologically from other con -\nnective tissue nevi that may occur as isolated developmental \ndefects in otherwise normal individuals.\nMiscellaneous Nevoid Lesions\nCaf\u00e9-au-lait spots may occur as an isolated finding in 10% \nto 20% of tuberous sclerosis patients. Patches of gray \nor white have also been noted in up to 20% of patients \nwith tuberous sclerosis. Fibromas of various sizes and \nshapes may occur in other locations. These include: (1) \nlarge, asymmetrical fibromas of the face and scalp, called  \nfibrous cephalic plaque; (2) soft, pedunculated growths \non the neck, trunk, or extremities (molluscum fibrosum \npendulum); (3) grouped, firm papules of the neck, trunk, \nand extremities; and (4) pedunculated or sessile nodules \nof the buccal or gingival mucosa. The forehead plaque is \nobserved in about 25% of patients and may be the most \nspecific skin finding for TSC. Multiple gingival fibromas \nare a minor feature in the clinical criteria of TSC.\nCentral Nervous System Involvement\nFocal or generalized seizures occur in up to 90% of \npatients with tuberous sclerosis and may be the first \nsymptom to suggest the diagnosis. Infantile spasms, which are generalized myoclonic seizures, are a com -\nmon presenting symptom of TSC. These are largely \nrelated to glioneuronal hamartomas, called cortical  \ntubers, and subependymal nodules. Cortical glioneuro -\nnal hamartomas and subependymal nodules are identi -\nfied by brain MRI in over 80% of patients with TSC. \nMost lesions are multiple and involve the frontal or \nparietal lobe. These tumors calcify in about 50% of \npatients and produce characteristic roentgenographic \nchanges. A characteristic brain tumor, called subepen -\ndymal giant cell tumors (SGCTs), are found in 5% to \n20% of patients. Also called subependymal giant cell  \nastrocytomas, these tumors may enlarge and obstruct \nthe flow of cerebrospinal fluid and result in hydro -\ncephalus. It is thought that SGCTs arise from pre-\nexisting subependymal nodules. The number of tubers \ncorrelates with the extent of seizure status and cogni -\ntive function. Sixty to 70% of patients demonstrate \nboth seizures and cognitive impairment by 3 years of \nage. Cerebral white matter radial migration lines are \nanother form of cortical dysplasia, which is associated \nwith epilepsy and learning difficulties. Intellectual dis -\nability has a prevalence of 40% to 50% in TSC.

However, the early and \npotentially reversible form of this disease would more \nappropriately be termed morpheaform. This is because \nthese earlier lesions are circumscribed firm plaques mea -\nsuring several centimeters in diameter and thus have a \nclinical appearance very similar to that of morphea.

This should come as no surprise, given the overlap be -\ntween deep morphea and eosinophilic fasciitis.

For chronic GVHD limited \nto the skin, topical corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, \npsoralens plus UVA (PUVA), UVA-I, or extracorporeal \nphotopheresis can be employed.

There are \nalso a number of cases of cirrhosis that are idiopathic. \nIndividuals with cirrhosis usually present in one of two \ngeneral ways, i.e., (1) with evidence of acute hepatocel -\nlular necrosis with jaundice; or (2) with evidence of the \ncomplications of cirrhosis, brought on primarily by the \nrise in intrahepatic vascular resistance and subsequent \nportal hypertension (i.e., ascites, splenomegaly, bleeding \nvarices, and encephalopathy). Not infrequently, patients \npresent with a mixed picture of these two pathophysi -\nologic pathways.\nThe dermatological stigmata of cirrhosis are well rec -\nognized and include changes in the skin, nails, and hair. \nVascular lesions are common and include spider angiomas \nand other telangiectases; palmar erythema; and dilated \nabdominal wall veins, which occur in patients with por -\ntal hypertension and represent the development of portal \nsystemic collaterals ( Figs 30-2 to 30-4 ). Spider angiomas occur in a majority of patients with cirrhosis, but they \nare not pathognomonic of the disease because they occur \ncommonly in young children, pregnant women, and oth -\nerwise healthy adults. They are so named because of their \ncentral pulsatile arterial punctum with radiating branch -\ning vessels. They occur almost exclusively on the upper \nhalf of the body, especially on the face, neck, and upper \ntrunk. The spider is formed by a coiled arteriole that spi -\nrals up to a central point and then branches out into thin-\nwalled vessels that merge with normal capillaries. The \npathogenesis of these vascular lesions is unknown, but \nthey do not appear to be related to portal hypertension, \nwhich is responsible for one of the most serious complica -\ntions of cirrhosis: bleeding esophageal and gastric varices. \nThey may be related to excess estrogen, which occurs as \na result of reduced hepatic metabolism of estrogens. Pal -\nmar erythema, manifested as diffuse or splotchy erythema \non the thenar and hypothenar eminences and tips of the \nfingers, frequently accompanies the development of the \nspider angiomas.

It is a process distinct from \nnormal physiologic mottling of the palm from inciting \nfactors such as temperature as it is thought to be a mi -\ncrovascular complication of diabetes.\nPeriungual Telangiectases\nPeriungual telangiectases or nailbed erythema is a rela -\ntively common cutaneous finding in diabetic patients, \nseen in up to 65%. Clinically, the proximal nailfold will \nappear reddish in color. Slit-lamp examination will show \nvisibly dilated capillaries around the nail bed caused by \ndilation of the superficial vascular plexus due to diabetic \nmicroangiopathy. It is asymptomatic, although it can be \nassociated with cuticle changes and tenderness in the fin -\ngertips.\nPigmented Purpura\nPigmented purpura, or pigmented purpuric dermatoses, \npresents as asymptomatic orange to brown nonblanch -\ning patches that are often seen in the lower extremities. \nThese skin findings, which must be distinguished clini -\ncally from stasis-associated hemosiderin deposition, are \nseen together with diabetic dermopathy and occur more \noften in elderly patients. It develops in later stages of the \ndisease due to increasing fragility of capillary vessels as -\nsociated with microangiopathy, which leads to extrava -\nsation of erythrocytes and deposition of hemosiderin in \nmacrophages (siderophages).\nRubeosis Faciei\nRubeosis faciei is a chronic flushed appearance of the face, \nneck, and occasionally the extremities. It is more promi -\nnent in fair-skinned individuals, with an estimated preva -\nlence of 8% in diabetic patients, although prevalence up to \n59% has been reported in hospitalized diabetic patients. \nThe clinical appearance is the result of microangiopathic \nalterations and superficial facial venous dilation, which \nmay be due to reduced vasoconstrictor tone. Optimal glycemic control and reduced intake of vasodilators, in -\ncluding alcohol and caffeine, help alleviate symptoms.\nYellow Skin and Nails\nYellowish hue in the skin and nails is an asymptomatic \nbenign finding among diabetics. The most affected ar -\neas are those of prominent sebaceous activity such as \nthe face, areas with a thick stratum corneum such as the \npalms and soles, and the nails. The skin changes may be \ndue to disproportionate accumulation of carotene in the \nskin caused by impairment of its hepatic conversion. An -\nother theory attributes the yellow skin to dermal collagen \nglycosylation with end-stage glycosylation products. This \ncondition improves with tight glycemic control.\nInfections\nCutaneous infections occur in 20% to 50% of patients with \ndiabetes and are more prevalent in individuals with poorly \ncontrolled type 2 diabetes than those with type 1 disease. \nPoor glycemic control increases the risk of infection by \ncausing abnormal microcirculation, reduced phagocytosis, \nimpaired leukocyte adherence, and delayed chemotaxis.\nFungal Infections\nFungal infections are the most prevalent type of cutane -\nous infection in diabetic patients. Candidal infections are \ncommon and often the first manifestation of DM. Can -\ndidal infections can cause angular stomatitis, paronychia, \nbalanitis, and vulvovaginitis. Treatment requires the use \nof topical or oral antifungal agents, keeping the affected \nsite dry, and, most importantly, blood glucose control.\nDermatophyte infections can present a significant \nthreat in diabetics. Diabetic neuropathy in the distal lower \nextremities creates an ideal environment for dermatophyte \ninfections, allowing benign cases of tinea pedis to become \ndevastating. Breaks in the normal skin barrier due to tinea \ncan lead to superficial bacterial infections such as erysipelas \nand cellulitis, and even sepsis or fungemia. For this reason, \ntinea pedis should be promptly and aggressively treated.\nDM with debilitating ketosis increases the risk for \nlife-threatening mucormycosis ( Fig. 24-11 ).",

Specific antibodies \nsynthesized in response to the toxin confer immunity.\nClinical Manifestations . Scarlet fever occurs predomi -\nnantly in children and typically follows streptococcal \npharyngitis or tonsillitis. The characteristic cutaneous \neruption consists of punctate erythematous papules, re -\nsulting in a sandpaper texture. The eruption begins on \nthe neck and spreads caudally to involve the trunk and \nextremities. The palms and soles are generally spared. \nThe face appears flushed, with a circumoral pallor. Pete -\nchiae may be present in creases of the elbows, groin, and \naxillae, a finding commonly referred to as Pastia\u2019s lines. \nThe eruption begins to fade after 4 to 5 days with residual desquamation.

Penicillin is currently the treatment of choice. \nErythromycin may be used in penicillin-sensitive patients.\nRheumatic Fever\nRheumatic fever is a sequela of an upper respiratory in -\nfection with group A streptococci. The disease is charac -\nterized by inflammatory lesions affecting the joints, heart, \nskin, and central nervous system.

The clinical manifestations \nof acute rheumatic fever include erythema marginatum, \nsubcutaneous nodules, polyarthritis, carditis, and cho -\nrea. The latency period between the antecedent strepto -\ncoccal pharyngitis and the onset of symptoms of acute \nrheumatic fever is about 3 weeks. Erythema margin -\natum begins as an erythematous macule or papule that \nextends centrifugally as the central areas clear. Adjacent \nlesions may coalesce and form a serpiginous pattern. The  \nlesions are evanescent, but the overall eruption may persist \nfor weeks. The subcutaneous nodules are firm, painless  \nlesions varying in size from a few millimeters to a few \ncentimeters. The overlying skin is freely movable and \nis not inflamed. These lesions occur in crops over bony \nprominences or tendons.\nDiagnosis . The diagnostic criteria originally defined by \nDuckett Jones use major and minor criteria to support \nthe diagnosis with a high degree of probability.\nTreatment . Treatment with penicillin within 1 week of \nthe onset of sore throat may prevent the subsequent onset \nof rheumatic fever. Antibiotics do not modify the course \nof an acute rheumatic attack.

This disorder \nconsists of a triad of clubbing of the fingers and toes; peri -\nosteal proliferation of the phalanges and long bones; and \nswelling of the soft tissue overlying bony structures. The \nmost common manifestation of acropachy is clubbing of \nthe fingernails and toenails, which occurs in 19% of pa -\ntients who have thyroid dermopathy. The first, second, \nand fifth metacarpals, the proximal phalanges of the hand, \nand the first metatarsal and proximal phalanges of the feet \nare most often affected.

EN usually presents as an acute eruption of tender, erythematous subcutaneous nodules over the bilateral pretibial areas (Fig. 12-1), with other locations being occasionally in-volved, particularly the thighs and forearms. Unlike other forms of panniculitis, ulceration is not a feature of EN. The lesions usually last for a few days or weeks and then slowly involute, changing in color like an ecchymosis, and healing without scar formation. More chronic forms do occur, some of which show a tendency toward migration or centrifugal spread, referred to as subacute nodular mi-\ngratory panniculitis or erythema nodosum migrans. This en-tity is believed by many authors to represent a variant of EN; however, others consider it to be a separate disorder. Untreated, subacute nodular migratory panniculitis can last for months to years.\nHistopathologically, EN is the prototype of a pre-\ndominantly septal panniculitis; however, changes are not entirely confined to the connective septa of the subcutis. Biopsy specimens of early lesions usually show edema -\ntous septa and mild lymphocytic infiltrates, although sometimes neutrophils may predominate. True vasculitis is not demonstrable; however, \u201csecondary\u201d vasculitis may occasionally be observed in lesions with heavy, mixed, or neutrophil-rich inflammatory infiltrates. Miescher\u2019s ra-dial granulomas, which are small collections of macro -\nphages surrounding small cleft-like spaces, usually found within septa ( Fig. 12-2), can also be observed in the early \nstages of EN. As lesions progress, the septa become wid -\nened and contain a mixed, partly granulomatous infiltrate that invades the periphery of the adjacent fat lobules in a lace-like configuration. The extent of lobular involve -\nment may vary, and in some cases can be prominent, es -\npecially at the periphery of the fat lobule. Finally, in later stages, the septa become fibrotic, partly replacing the fat lobules, with residual granulomas and lipophages.\nThe basic evaluation of a patient with EN is summa -\nrized in Table 12-2. Further evaluation can be performed in a cost-effective manner if it is guided by the history, physical examination, and laboratory screening test re -\nsults, always taking into account the most important etiologic considerations depending on geographical lo -\ncation. Finally, identification and treatment of the un -\nderlying disorder, if found, is of primary importance, but therapy directed toward the lesions themselves is also an option. In this context, treatments most often recommended for uncomplicated EN include bed rest, salicylates, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Potassium iodide has been used with success, with adult \ndosages ranging from 300 to 1500  mg/day, and improve -\nment is typically seen within 2  weeks. In cases of EN  \nassociated with underlying conditions, the treatment of the associated disease is usually effective in managing coexistent EN. For example, colchicine is frequently used to treat EN that accompanies Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease, and various therapies aimed at treating inflammatory bowel disease may also help associated EN lesions. For more severe cases of EN, systemic corticosteroids are occasionally utilized in the absence of an underlying infection.\nFIGURE 12-1  n Erythema nodosum demonstrating erythematous \nnodules on the anterior aspects of the lower legs.\nA\nBB\nFIGURE 12-2  n Histopathologic features of erythema nodosum. \nA, Scanning power magnification showing a predominantly \nseptal panniculitis.

In \nsubcutaneous Sweet\u2019s, neutrophils are localized to the \nsubcutis. Though the infiltrate may be more pronounced \nin perivascular areas, vasculitis is classically absent.

Laboratory findings include increased erythro -\ncyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein as well as \nleukocytosis often with neutrophilia. Clinicians should be \naware, however, that Sweet\u2019s can develop in neutrope -\nnic patients, typically in the setting of acute myelogenous \nleukemia.\nAssociated Conditions\nSweet\u2019s syndrome has been described with a variety of \ndiseases including malignancy (most commonly acute \nmyelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, \nbut also lymphomas and solid organ tumors), autoim -\nmune disease, sarcoid, inflammatory bowel disease \n(IBD), and infection ( Streptococcus , Mycobacterium tubercu -\nlosis, viral hepatitis). Sweet\u2019s has also been reported with \npregnancy and after vaccination. Many medications have \nbeen implicated in cases of Sweet\u2019s including G-CSF, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, azathioprine, oral con -\ntraceptives, hydralazine, and minocycline, among others.\nTreatment\nSweet\u2019s syndrome is usually an acute, steroid-responsive \ndisease. Oral prednisone (generally 40 to 60 mg/day) \ntypically leads to a dramatic response, with resolution of \nfever and improvement of skin lesions. Steroids are gen -\nerally tapered over 2 to 6 weeks. Pulse dosing of meth -\nylprednisolone may be required for severe or refractory \ndisease. Colchicine and potassium iodide are also con -\nsidered first-line treatment, with dapsone, cyclosporine, \nclofazimine, and indometacin considered second line. \nIndividual cases and small case series have reported \nsuccess with thalidomide, chlorambucil, cyclophos -\nphamide, retinoids, and, more recently, tumor necrosis \nfactor- alpha (TNF- \u03b1) inhibitors and IL-1 antagonists. \nIn patients with underlying disease the onset of Sweet\u2019s \nlesions often occurs in the setting of poor control of the \nunderlying disease, which should be a primary consider -\nation in therapeutic decisions.\nPYODERMA GANGRENOSUM\nClinical Manifestations\nPyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is an uncommon neu -\ntrophilic dermatosis typically presenting with rapidly \n expanding cutaneous ulcerations. The diagnostic evalua -\ntion of a patient presumed to have PG has two objectives: \n(1) to exclude other causes of cutaneous ulceration, as this \nis a diagnosis of exclusion; and (2) to determine whether \nthere is an associated treatable systemic disorder.\nThe ulceration(s) of classic PG are often clinically \ncharacteristic. The border is well defined with a deep \nerythematous to violaceous color ( Fig. 5-5 ). The lesion \nextends peripherally, and often the border overhangs the \nulceration (undermined). Pain is a prominent feature. As \nthe lesion heals, scar formation occurs that may be in a \ncribriform pattern. Lesions may display pathergy and \n aggressive debridement of PG lesions should be avoided \n especially during the active, expanding disease phase. \nSeveral variants of PG have been described.",

Despite initial concerns about adverse ef -\nfects of pregnancy on malignant melanoma, most re -\ncent studies consistently demonstrate that pregnancy \ndoes not adversely affect the survival of women diag -\nnosed with localized melanoma before, during, or af -\nter pregnancy. Melanoma prognosis for the pregnant \nwoman should be based on the same established cri -\nteria, including Breslow depth and ulceration, utilized \nfor nonpregnant patients. Transplacental metastasis of  \nmaternal malignancy is rare; malignant melanoma, how -\never, is the most common malignancy to metastasize to \nthe placenta (20 cases). In the setting of placental mela -\nnoma metastasis, fetal metastasis occurs in only 25%, \nand the most common sites are the skin and liver.

MGUS is defined as a \nserum monoclonal protein <30  g/L; <10% plasma cells  \nin the bone marrow; and the absence of end-organ dam -\nage (hyperc alcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, and/or \nbone lesions [CRAB]).

Three risk factors are useful in predicting the likelihood \nof progression (as measured at 20  years\u2019 follow-up): (1)  \nan increase in serum-free light chains; (2) an MGUS of nonimmunoglobulin G (IgG) origin; or (3) a serum \nM protein of 15  g/L or more. The risk of multiple my -\neloma at 20  years was 58% with all three risk factors,  \n37% with two risk factors, 21% with one risk factor, and 5% when no risk factors were present. Smoldering myeloma is a term used to describe an asymptomatic phase of myeloma characterized by a serum IgG or IgA  monoclonal protein >30  g/L and/or >10% plasma cells  \nin the bone marrow, but no evidence of myeloma-  \nrelated end-organ damage. In this group, the cumula-tive probability of progression to active multiple myelo -\nma or amyloidosis was 51% at 5  years, 66% at 10  years,  \nand 73% at 15  years, with a median time to progression  \nof 4.8  years.\nDISORDERS DIRECTLY RELATED  \nTO MONOCLONAL PROTEINS\nPathogenesis\nMonoclonal proteins may cause disease directly by act-\ning as cryoglobulins, by raising serum viscosity, or by acting as cold agglutinins. Cryoglobulins are immuno-globulins with temperature-dependent conformational change leading to water insolubility and precipitation on exposure to cold. They may be unstable in other settings, such as in the hyperosmotic environment found in the kidneys, or in microvascular areas with a slow blood flow. The most critical factor that determines the behavior \nof the cryoglobulin in  vivo is the temperature at which \nit begins to precipitate. If that temperature approaches those found in the cutaneous microvasculature on cold exposure, cold-induced disease is usually significant. If it precipitates only at a temperature well below room temperature, symptoms, if any, will not be cold-related. Cryoglobulins are divided into three categories, depend -\ning on their composition. Type I cryoglobulins consist of a single monoclonal protein; type II are composed of a monoclonal immunoglobulin with anti-IgG (rheuma -\ntoid factor) activity that binds to polyclonal serum IgG; and type III cryoglobulins consist of polyclonal immu -\nnoglobulins, usually with anti-IgG activity, that bind to polyclonal serum IgG (a polyclonal rheumatoid factor). Types I and II cryoglobulinemia are often (but not al -\nways) associated with a lymphoproliferative disorder or plasma cell dyscrasia. Patients with type II cryoglobuli-nemia may have IgM, IgG, or IgA as their monoclonal rheumatoid factor. Only IgM rheumatoid factor testing is routinely available. Since the monoclonal protein is bound to a polyclonal IgG antigen, serum protein elec-trophoresis may not show a discrete M-spike, and if the specimen is allowed to cool before sampling, all studies will be negative.\nThe hyperviscosity syndrome results from a signifi -\ncant increase in whole blood viscosity.",

The pathogenesis of pruritus of cholestasis is unknown. It has been associat -\ned with accumulation of bile salts and increased opioider -\ngic tone, and recent studies suggest an important role of elevated lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). LPA is a phospho-lipid that is formed by autotaxin. Both LPA and elevated autotaxin have been found to be correlated with cholestatic itch of different types.  Therapy with bile acid sequestrants \nsuch as cholestyramine and ursodeoxycholic acid may pro-vide some relief. As patients also have high plasma levels of opioids, opioid antagonists (such as naltrexone) have been shown to reduce cholestatic itch. Hepatitis C can be asso -\nciated with severe generalized itching, and in severe cases itch is considered an indication for liver transplantation,  \nalthough with novel hepatitis C antiviral treatments and their high response rates this may no longer be necessary in the future.\nLYMPHOMAS, LEUKEMIA, AND \nHEMATOLOGIC DISEASE\nPruritus is an important sign that may have prognostic \nsignificance in several of the malignant lymphomas. It could be the presenting symptom of lymphoma. Wide -\nspread cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and erythrodermic forms, including S\u00e9zary syndrome (T-cell leukemia), cause an intractable severe itch that is difficult to treat. Thirty percent of patients with Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma experience generalized pruritus at some time during the course of their disease. The pruritus of Hodgkin\u2019s lym -\nphoma is usually related to the disease\u2019s activity. Pruritus may be experienced more intensely at night. Pruritus is an infrequent accompanying symptom of multiple my-eloma. The mechanism of pruritus in these conditions remains unknown. Recent studies have shown that in-creased serum and mRNA levels of interleukin 31, a TH2 pruritic cytokine, correlate with the severity of cutane -\nous T-cell lymphoma pruritus. Reduced serum levels of this cytokine post treatment with oral corticosteroids and histone deacetylase inhibitors correlated with significant reduction in itch in these patients.\nApproximately 50% of patients with polycythemia vera \ndevelop pruritus that usually occurs after exposure to wa -\nter (bath itch).

The mechanism of pruritus in iron deficiency is unknown.\nENDOCRINE DISEASE\nPruritus is an important symptom of hyperthyroidism and could be a presenting symptom. The underlying mechanism of this itch is unknown. Hypothyroidism less frequently causes itch related to the associated asteatosis (dry skin).Secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with renal \ndisease is often associated with generalized pruritus.\nDiabetes mellitus is now believed to be a cause of lo -\ncalized, not generalized, pruritus.

ICP should \nalso be considered in the setting of pruritus without pri -\nmary cutaneous lesions.\nIntrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy\nIntrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP, icterus gravi -\ndarum, obstetric cholestasis, prurigo gravidarum) is the \nmost common pregnancy-specific liver disorder and the \nsecond most common cause of jaundice in pregnancy. \nIncidence varies by geography and is much higher in \nSouth America (9.2% to 15.6%) than in Scandinavia \n(1.5%) or Europe (0.1% to 0.2%). Risk factors include \nadvanced maternal age (>35 years), multiparity, history \nof intrahepatic cholestasis in previous pregnancy, history \nof oral contraceptive use, and family history of intrahe -\npatic cholestasis. Genetic, hormonal, and environmental \n(seasonal, geographic) factors have been implicated in the \npathogenesis. Patients with ICP have mutations in the \nhepatic phospholipid transporter MDR3/ABCB4, ami -\nnophospholipid transporter (ATP8B1/FIC1), and bile \nsalt export protein (BSEP/ABCB11). Clinical presenta -\ntion varies from mild pruritus without jaundice to chole -\nstatic jaundice. Pruritus typically develops after 30 weeks \ngestation; it is often initially acral, worsens at nighttime, \nand may precede laboratory abnormalities. Cutaneous \nfindings are limited to excoriations and prurigo papules/\nnodules. Nonspecific symptoms include anorexia, epigas -\ntric discomfort, fatigue, insomnia, and malaise.

Despite having this upregulation of \ntype I interferons in common, it is thought that the im \u00ad\nmunopathogenesis of dermatomyositis and polymyositis is \ndifferent. In polymyositis, clonally expanded autoreactive \nCD8\u00adpositive T cells invade myocytes expressing major \nhistocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens and \ncause necrosis via the perforin pathway. In dermatomy \u00ad\nositis, autoantigens activate a humoral immune process \nin which complement is deposited in capillaries, causing \ncapillary necrosis and ischemia. For both diseases, a ge \u00ad\nnetic predisposition has also been suggested. Thus, under \nappropriate circumstances in an immunogenetically pre \u00ad\ndisposed individual, an infection, drug, trauma, or neo \u00ad\nplasm may be able to initiate an inflammatory reaction in \nthe muscle and skin. Through a complex set of reactions \ninvolving immunologic phenomena, muscle damage and \ncutaneous disease may occur.\nMANIFESTATIONS\nCutaneous Manifestations\nThe characteristic and possibly pathognomonic cutane \u00ad\nous features of dermatomyositis are the heliotrope erup \u00ad\ntion and Gottron\u2019s papules. Several other cutaneous \nfeatures that occur in patients with dermatomyositis are \ncharacteristic of the disease but are not pathognomonic. \nThese include midfacial erythema that involves the na \u00ad\nsolabial folds (as opposed to the malar erythema in lupus \nerythematosus, which spares the nasolabial folds), poi \u00ad\nkiloderma in a photosensitive distribution on the chest \n(\u201cV\u00adneck\u201d sign) or back (shawl sign), a violaceous ery \u00ad\nthema on the extensor surfaces, alopecia with or without \nscaly poikilodermatous changes, a scaly poikiloderma \u00ad\ntous rash on the lateral thighs (Holster sign), and peri \u00ad\nungual and cuticular changes. The cutaneous disease in \ndermatomyositis is photodistributed and often photoag \u00ad\ngravated. In addition, pruritus may be a prominent fea \u00ad\nture in dermatomyositis, and may be helpful in clinically \ndistinguishing this entity from lupus erythematosus. \nQuality\u00adof\u00adlife impairment in dermatomyositis is great \u00ad\ner than in other skin diseases, including both psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, based on its cutaneous manifes \u00ad\ntations alone.

Re \u00ad\nactivation of any skin manifestation of dermatomyositis \nin a patient otherwise considered to be in remission may \nsignify a relapse of the myositis. Most often, however, \nthe activity of the muscle disease is not reflected by that \nof the cutaneous disease.\nThe heliotrope eruption consists of a dusky erythema \u00ad\ntous to violaceous cutaneous eruption with or without \nedema involving the periorbital skin in a symmetric dis \u00ad\ntribution ( Fig. 2\u00ad1 ). Often only the upper lid is involved. \nSometimes this sign is subtle and may involve only faint \nerythema along the eyelid margin. Gottron\u2019s papules are \nfound over bony prominences, particularly the metacar \u00ad\npophalangeal joints, the proximal interphalangeal joints, \nand/or the distal interphalangeal joints.

In a review of patients with APD, \n50% of patients had diabetes, and 91% of diabetic patients \nhad chronic renal failure due to diabetic nephropathy.\nPathogenesis\nThe pathogenesis is not fully understood, though proposed \ntheories include epidermal or dermal alterations as a result \nof metabolic derangements, deposition of a substance not \nremoved through dialysis, and microtrauma as a result of \nchronic scratching and rubbing or as a manifestation of \nmicroangiopathy. Recent molecular studies have suggested \nthat minor trauma or scratching in patients with DM leads \nto keratinocyte exposure to dermal interstitial advanced \nglycation end product-modified collagens, which interact \nand migrate upward together from the basal to the horny \nlayers of the skin, leading to transepidermal elimination.\nTreatment\nLesions are chronic and relatively unresponsive to ther -\napy, but may resolve slowly over months if scratching and trauma are avoided. Thus, treatment is directed at \nsymptomatic relief of pruritus. Topical and systemic reti -\nnoids, topical and intradermal corticosteroids, cryother -\napy, psoralen plus UVA light (PUVA), UV light therapy, \nallopurinol, and doxycycline are treatment options with \nvarying reports of efficacy.

Perilesional skin and frequently serum from BP patients demonstrate the presence of IgG autoantibody directed against two dis -\ntinct hemidesmosomal antigens: a 230-kDa glycoprotein bullous pemphigoid antigen 1 (BPAG1 or BP230) that reacts with circulating antibodies in 50% to 70% of cases, and the 180-kDa bullous pemphigoid antigen 2 (BPAG2 or BP180) with extracellular collagen-like domains that is reactive in 30% to 50% of cases. The BP antigens are normal components of the basement membrane zone, but, as is the case in pemphigus, patients become intoler -\nant to these antigens. The HLA DQB1*0301 allele may be important in initial antigen processing. Autoreactive T lymphocytes producing Th1 and particularly Th2 cyto-kines are critically involved in the initiation of production of pathogenic autoantibodies in BP.\nAntibodies to BPAG2, also known as collagen XVII, \nbind to a noncollagenous region of the molecule outside the cell membrane in the lamina lucida. Several points support the pathogenic role of anti-BPAG2 antibodies in BP. Firstly, passive transfer experiments in mice have re -\nsulted in blister formation when rabbit-derived antibod-ies to murine BPAG2 are injected. Secondly, sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) testing shows that BP180 antibody titers correlate with disease severity. Finally, IgG antibodies to BPAG2 in the related condition pemphigoid gestationis can cross the placenta and cause blisters in the fetuses of mothers with this dis -\nease. Passive transfer experiments in mice have produced inflammation and subepidermal blistering. Because BPAG1 is an intracytoplasmic molecule it has been sug -\ngested that anti-BPAG1 antibodies may develop second -\narily after initial skin injury by anti-BPAG2 antibodies.\nBPAG2 IgG antibodies are thought to cause blister -\ning by complement and neutrophil activation. Several pieces of information support a role for complement in the pathogenesis of BP lesions. Complement deposits \nhave been detected in  vivo in the lamina lucida, and the \ncomplement membrane attack complex has been identi -\nfied in involved skin. The stimulus for leukocyte attach -\nment is activated complement components released by immune complex activation. Neutrophils are recruited by C5a-dependent pathways. Their pathogenicity is in -\nferred by the finding that mice deficient in gelatinase-B (a neutrophil enzyme) were protected from blistering in passive transfer experiments. When neutrophils from normal mice were injected into the gelatinase-deficient mice they developed blisters.\nDegranulation of mast cells mediated by complement-\nderived anaphylatoxins, eosinophil activation, or a direct effect of IgG antibody is responsible for the release of chemotactic factors, proteolytic enzymes, and vasoactive amines, which subsequently mediate dermoepidermal separation. IgE is emerging as an important pathogenic factor in BP. IgE antibodies against BPAG1 and BPAG2 have been detected in a high percentage of BP patients, with anti-BPAG1 IgE levels correlating with local eosin -\nophil recruitment. SCID mice injected with an IgE-pro -\nducing hybridoma directed toward the shed ectodomain of BPAG2 developed histologically evident subepidermal blisters in human skin grafts. Finally, IgE anti-BPAG2 is related to disease activity and severity.\nSeveral reports have indicated that patients with BP \nmay develop further blistering on exposure to ultraviolet light. The mechanism for this may be related to ultravio -\nlet light activation of mast cells.\nClassification\nThe term BP is generally reserved for patients demon -\nstrating a chronic, vesiculobullous eruption involving predominantly nonmucosal surfaces. The distribution is usually widespread, with sites of predilection including the lower abdomen, inner thighs, groin, axilla, and flexur -\nal aspects of the arms and legs.

Patients \nwith these manifestations should undergo a lung biopsy \nand, possibly, mediastinal nodal biopsies. Stages II and III \npulmonary sarcoidosis are associated with a much higher \nincidence of chronic progressive disease, and resolution \nof the X-ray findings becomes less likely.

Acute ocular sarcoidosis generally runs a course of 2 years or less, during which time active therapy may \nbe needed. Chronic eye disease is less common.

Patients may be entirely asymptomatic, or they \nmay present with a red eye, photophobia, or increased \ntear production ( Fig. 36-14 ). The diagnosis is made by \nslit-lamp examination, which reveals \u201cmutton fat\u201d keratic  \nprecipitates in the anterior chamber. Less commonly, the \nposterior segment of the eye is involved, and its appear -\nance correlates well with chorioretinitis and neurosar -\ncoidosis. Uveitis must be aggressively treated to prevent \nadhesions, with resulting glaucoma, cataract develop -\nment, or blindness. As ocular sarcoidosis may be clini -\ncally asymptomatic, up to the point of severe visual com -\npromise, patients must undergo regular screening with at \nleast annual ophthalmological exams.\nAnother common ocular finding in patients with sar -\ncoidosis is conjunctival and lacrimal gland involvement. \nThis may or may not produce symptoms of ocular irrita -\ntion.

Specific \ncardiovascular risk factors, such as obesity, hypertriglyc -\neridemia, and metabolic syndrome, have been linked \nwith  psoriasis, and recent meta-analyses confirmed asso -\nciations with diabetes and hypertension as well. Further -\nmore, a recent population-based study linked psoriasis \nwith chronic kidney disease, and a recent meta-analysis \nassociated mild psoriasis with increased risk of stroke and \nmyocardial infarction. The precise mechanisms respon -\nsible for these associations are still being evaluated, but \nshared pathways between skin inflammation and athero -\nsclerosis, particularly involving T cells and neutrophils, \nhave been proposed. The impact of psoriasis therapy on \ncardiovascular risk remains unclear, but recent epidemio -\nlogic data support a protective effect, particularly with \ntumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. In fact, a large \nretrospective study suggests that TNF inhibitors, oral \nmedications (i.e., methotrexate, cyclosporine, acitretin), \nand phototherapy may confer a decreased cardiovascular \nrisk, with the strongest association seen with TNF inhibi -\ntors. Additionally, in a large Danish population-based \nstudy, TNF inhibitors and methotrexate were associated \nwith a decreased risk for cardiovascular events and all-\ncause mortality. Recent expert group consensus has ad -\nvocated for cardiovascular risk assessment in all patients \nwith moderate\u2013severe psoriasis, including annual blood \npressure, body mass index, waist circumference, lipids, \nfasting glucose, HbA1c, and smoking status inquiries.\nMYOSITIS\nCardiac involvement in idiopathic inflammatory myopa -\nthies has been well described, including in patients with \ndermatomyositis. Subclinical involvement in the form of \nconduction abnormalities and arrhythmias frequently oc -\ncurs. Symptomatic CAD or heart failure is less common, \nbut can occur, with a recent meta-analysis reporting a \npooled risk ratio of 2.24 for CAD in idiopathic inflamma -\ntory myopathies. Overt cardiac disease portends a poor \nprognosis, and an increased death rate from myocar -\ndial infarction has been reported. It has been suggested \nthat systemic immunomodulatory therapy may improve \ncardiac manifestations in some patients. In the juvenile \npopulation, diabetes mellitus has been associated with \nlipodystrophy, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and cardiac involve -\nment, and recently, limited data suggest that sustained \nearly skin activity may predict cardiac systolic dysfunc -\ntion in this population.\nFIGURE 37-3  n Hyperextensible skin and joints seen in Ehlers\u2013\nDanlos syndrome.\nFIGURE 37-4  n Multiple lentigines in a patient with the LEOPARD \nsyndrome.

Neither normalization of calcium-phosphate \nhomeostasis nor removal of the parathyroid glands pro -\nvides uniform relief. Treatment options include emol -\nlients, antihistamines, topical corticosteroids, and UVB \nphototherapy; UVB phototherapy is generally the most ef -\nfective, often in conjunction with sedating antihistamines. \nRecent studies suggest that opiate-receptor antagonists, \nsuch as naloxone and naltrexone, or medications such as \ngabapentin or pregabalin, may be beneficial in some pa -\ntients; however, no treatment is universally successful. \nPruritus typically resolves after transplantation.\nPigmentary Alteration\nOccurring in 25% to 75% of the dialysis population, pig -\nmentary changes increase over time and are thought to be \nprimarily due to uremia. A yellowish hue, possibly from \ncutaneous deposition of retained urochromes and caro -\ntene, occurs over time. In addition, a brownish, photo -\ndistributed, hyperpigmentation may occur, which is due \nto excess melanin production stimulated by an elevation \nin poorly dialyzed beta-melanocyte stimulating hormone. \nFurthermore, deposition of hemosiderin, from iron over -\nload, can transform this hyperpigmentation to a more \nbrown-to-gray discoloration.\nBullous Disease (Porphyria  \nand Pseudoporphyria)\nVarious blistering disorders can be seen in patients with \nrenal disease and include porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), \npseudoporphyria, and the poorly understood bullous \ndisease of dialysis. The development of PCT in patients \nwith ESRD is likely multifactorial: plasma porphyrins are \npoorly dialyzed and elevated in many dialysis patients; \niron overload from blood transfusions; and an increased \nincidence of hepatitis C in the dialysis population may be \nrelated factors. Pseudoporphyria and the bullous disease \nof dialysis are clinically similar to PCT, but lack the as -\nsociated elevated porphyrin levels ( Fig. 38-7 ). Many of \nthese cases may be medication-related. These conditions \nare further summarized in Chapter 28 .\nUremic Frost\nFirst described in 1865 by Hirschsprung, uremic frost \nis rarely encountered today due to the widespread avail -\nability of dialysis. When the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) \nlevel rises, urea concentrates in the sweat and deposits \non the skin following evaporation. The crystals are vis -\nible, giving rise to uremic frost, only when the BUN is \nextremely high, usually greater than 250 to 300 mg/dL. \nThis condition is typically first seen in the beard area, or \non other areas of the face, neck, or trunk, as fine white-\nto-yellow crystals. It represents a grave prognostic sign, \nunless therapy is emergently initiated.Xerosis\nFor unclear reasons, between 50% and 90% of patients \non dialysis have significant xerosis. Some suggest that the \nwater content of the skin may be decreased, perhaps in as -\nsociation with a reduction in sweat volume and/or atrophy \nof sebaceous glands, while others speculate a role for hy -\npervitaminosis A; however, when directly measured these \nlevels are typically normal in ESRD patients. Treatment \nincludes emollients, with or without keratolytic agents.\nDERMATOLOGIC CONDITIONS \nASSOCIATED WITH RENAL \nTRANSPLANTATION\nAlthough many patients with ESRD benefit from dialysis, \nit cannot fully compensate for kidney function, and the best \noption for many is renal allograft transplantation. This, \ntoo, can result in numerous cutaneous complications, both \nfrom the immunosuppressive medications essential for al -\nlograft survival and from the state of immunosuppression. \nThese conditions are summarized in Table 38-3 .\nSUGGESTED READINGS\nBernstein E J, Schmidt-Lauber C , Kay J .

According to the Writing Group of the Histiocyte Society in 1987, the histiocytoses can be broadly classified into three groups: Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH, class I), non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis (non-LCH, class II), and malignant histiocytosis (class III).\nHistiocytes of cutaneous importance are derived \nfrom bone marrow CD34+ progenitor cells. These cells can mature into Langerhans cells (which reside in the \n epidermis) or alternatively into monocytes, macrophages, \nor dendritic cells (which reside in the dermis or deeper soft tissues). Lesional tissue of LCH is composed of LCH cells (which have a similar immunophenotype to Langer-hans cells) while the non-LCH disorders are comprised of monocytes, macrophages, and/or dendritic cells.The malignant histocytic disorders are very rare and \nmost are aggressive. These will be discussed briefly at the conclusion of this chapter.\nCLASS I: LANGERHANS CELL \nHISTIOCYTOSIS\nPathogenesis\nThe pathogenesis of LCH was uncertain until recently \nand there was much debate as to whether to classify LCH as a reactive or neoplastic condition. Studies have not shown evidence of an infectious etiology, and demonstrated elevated levels of multiple cytokines and interleukins in LCH are believed to be produced by the LCH inflammatory cell infiltrate rather than being responsible for causing the disease.\nThe recent major discovery of recurrent BRAF 600E \nmutations provides strong evidence to regard LCH as a neoplastic condition. Rare cases of familial LCH have been documented as well, and several older studies have demonstrated consistent clonality in LCH tissue. Given these later findings, LCH appears to represent a clonal neoplastic disorder.\nClinical Manifestations\nLangerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disorder. \n Although it most commonly presents in children from \nages 1 to 3  years it can occur at any age and is more com -\nmon in males. The disease ranges from mild asymptom -\natic involvement of a single organ to severe, multiorgan system involvement with a high mortality. Given the wide range of disease expression, it is not surprising that the etiology of the disease was uncertain until later in the twentieth century, with four previously described syn -\ndromes found to represent overlapping clinical variants of LCH. These variants include Letterer\u2013Siwe disease, Hand\u2013Schuller\u2013Christian disease, eosinophilic granu -\nloma, and Hashimoto\u2013Pritzker (congenital self-healing reticulohistiocytosis). While it is well recognized that LCH is one disease with a broad clinical spectrum, it is still helpful to note the older variants for perspective.\nThe acute form of LCH with diffuse and multisystem \ninvolvement was previously referred to as Letterer\u2013Siwe \ndisease. While it usually presents in infants less than 2  years  \nof age, it can occur at any age. It presents as erythema -\ntous to skin-colored crusted 1 to 2-mm vesiculopustules, CHAPTER 22\nCutaneous  Manifestations  \nof the histioCytoses\nWarren T. Goodman  \u2022  Joshua R.

The onset ranges from the time \nof birth to late adulthood. In a report of 101 children with \nmastocytosis, disease onset occurred in 73% of patients \nwithin 6 months of age and 97% of patients by age 2 years. \nThe prevalence of mastocytosis among infants and chil -\ndren ranges from 5.4 cases per 1000 in a Spanish popula -\ntion to 1 case per 500 in a Mexican cohort. The prevalence \nof mastocytosis in adults is unknown but believed to be \neven more rare. This disorder is equally distributed be -\ntween males and females; it has been reported in all races, \nand most patients have no familial association; however, \nthere have been over 40 cases of familial mast cell disease, \nsome of which have involved several generations.\nPATHOGENESIS\nMCs are derived from CD34+ precursor cells arising in \nthe bone marrow and circulate as monocytic cells. Cir -\nculating mast cell precursors in the blood express CD34, \nthe tyrosine kinase KIT (CD117), and Fc \u03b3RII, but not \nhigh-affinity IgE receptors (Fc \u03b5RI). KIT is a type III \ntyrosine kinase that is expressed on MCs, melanocytes, \nprimitive hematopoietic stem cells, primordial germ cells, \nand interstitial cells of Cajal. Activation of KIT induces \ncellular growth and extends cell survival by preventing \napoptosis. The ligand for KIT is stem cell factor (SCF), \nwhich is important for mast cell growth. SCF is produced \nby bone marrow stromal cells, fibroblasts, keratinocytes, endothelial cells, and reproductive Sertoli and granulosa \ncells. Under normal conditions, once mast cell precursors \nenter tissues they become KIT+/CD34\u2212/Fc\u03b3RII\u2212/Fc\u03b5RI+ \nand develop characteristic cytoplasmic granules.\nAlterations in c-KIT  structure have been implicated \nin the pathogenesis of mast cell disease. Specifically, \nsomatic mutations in codon 816 of the c-KIT  proto-  \noncogene have been identified in adults and children with \nmastocytosis. The result is a substitution of the amino acid \naspartic acid (D) with valine (V) or another amino acid; \nexamples include D816V, D816Y, D816F, D816I, and \nD816H. This mutation causes constitutive activation of \nKIT, thereby leading to continued mast cell development. \nAdditional mutations in c-KIT  (del419, K509I, F522C, \nV533D, A533D, V559A, V560G, R815K, I817V, D820G, \nE839K) also have been reported in adults and children with \nmastocytosis, but are more rare. Frequently these muta -\ntions are detected in mRNA not DNA. In a recent study \nof 50 children with mastocytosis, ranging in age from 0 to \n16 years, activating mutations were detected in 86% of the \npatients. Forty-two percent were in codon 816 and the re -\nmainder were within the gene that encodes the proximal ex -\ntracellular region (fifth immunoglobulin-like domain). All \nthe c-KIT  mutations except M541L found in these children \nwere associated with constitutive KIT activation. Interest -\ningly, an inactivating mutation (e.g., E839K) also has been \ndescribed in a child with mastocytosis, In the extremely \nrare familial mast cell disease, c-KIT  mutation detection \nhas been variable, ranging from none to the expression of \nK509I and A533D mutations. The finding of inactivating \nor no c-KIT  mutations in some patients and families with \nmastocytosis suggests that factors beyond an abnormal \nKIT receptor play a role in this disease. In fact, additional \ngene mutations have been identified in some adult patients \nwith more advanced mastocytosis and include the tumor \nsuppressor gene TET2  as well as ASCL1 , JAK2 , SRSF2 , \nDNMT3A , RUNX1 , and CBL.",

Multiple forms of cutaneous xanthomas \nexist. While not entirely specific, different morphologies \ncan point toward particular forms of primary hyperlipo \u00ad\nproteinemia (see Table 26\u00ad1 ), or secondary hyperlipo \u00ad\nproteinemias (see Table 26\u00ad2 ), or other normolipemic \nconditions. Many of the primary hyperlipoproteinemias \nare now defined at a molecular level with specific apo \u00ad\nprotein or receptor mutations. A basic understanding of \nlipid metabolism provides insight into the pathogenesis of \nhyperlipoproteinemias.\nLIPID METABOLISM AND PRIMARY \nHYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIAS\nLipids are a heterogeneous group of fats or fat\u00adlike sub \u00ad\nstances that are insoluble in water, thus most plasma lipids \nare complexed as a lipoprotein with a hydrophilic phos \u00ad\npholipid and apoprotein shell. Lipoproteins are classified \nby their density, which is a reflection of the core lipid \ncontent. Chylomicrons and very\u00adlow\u00addensity lipoproteins  \n(VLDLs) have high triglyceride (TG) and low choles \u00ad\nterol ester (CE) content, while low\u00addensity lipoproteins \n(LDLs), intermediate\u00addensity lipoproteins (IDLs), and high\u00addensity lipoproteins (HDLs) have increasing CE \nand decreasing TG content. The lipoprotein structure \nallows the delivery of TG and CEs to peripheral cells for \nmetabolic functions via interaction between apoproteins \nand specific receptors. An example is the interaction of \nthe B100/E apoprotein found on VLDLs, IDLs, and \nLDLs and lipoprotein lipase on hepatocytes and capillary \nendothelium.\nTwo major pathways of lipoprotein synthesis exist: ex \u00ad\nogenous (dietary) and endogenous (hepatic production). \nIn the endogenous pathway, ingested TGs are taken up \nin the intestine and packaged with a small amount of CEs \ninto the central core of a chylomicron. These chylomi \u00ad\ncrons then enter the systemic circulation and release free \nfatty acids (via hydrolysis of the TGs) to the peripheral \ntissues. This process is mediated via the interaction be \u00ad\ntween apoprotein CII on the chylomicrons and lipopro \u00ad\ntein lipase on capillary endothelium. After release of the \nfree fatty acids a chylomicron remnant is taken up by the \nliver via the apoprotein B100/E receptor.\nIn the endogenous pathway the liver forms VLDLs \nfrom circulating free fatty acids and hepatic TG stores. \nThe rate\u00adlimiting enzyme is HMG\u00adCoA, the target \nof the statin class of antihypercholesterolemia agents. \nVLDLs enter the circulation and after removal of TG \ncontent (via interaction of apoprotein CII on VLDL \nand lipoprotein lipase on the endothelium), an IDL is \nformed. IDLs are taken up by the liver or remain in cir \u00ad\nculation and become LDLs. LDLs deliver cholesterol to \nperipheral tissues for use in synthesis of cell membrane \nbilayers, myelin nerve sheaths, and for steroidogenesis \nand bile acid production. LDLs are ultimately taken up \nby the liver via apoprotein B100/E. HDLs transfer ex \u00ad\ncess CEs from peripheral tissues and transfer them to \nother lipoproteins (LDLs, VLDLs, or chylomicrons) \nfor transportation back to the liver. The clinical empha \u00ad\nsis on low levels of LDL and high levels of HDL reflects \nappropriate levels of production and removal of choles \u00ad\nterols in the circulation.\nPrimary Hyperlipoproteinemias\nVarious classification schemas have been proposed \nfor the primary hyperlipoproteinemias.

This condition is a cystic lung disease, which \ncan result in significant limitation of pulmonary function. \nPneumothorax, progressive exertional dyspnea, and cor \npulmonale may occur. This condition may worsen during \npregnancy and can be a life-threatening complication of \nTSC.

Dental pitting has a high \nprevalence in TSC and is a minor feature in the clinical \ncriteria of TSC.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nDiagnosis may be difficult as there is no single symptom \npresent in all patients. The characteristic skin ash leaf \nmacules in children with seizures and/or mental retarda -\ntion are sufficient to establish the diagnosis. However, \nthe early stages of the disease and the forme fruste may \ngive trouble in diagnosis. Some features of TSC remain \nasymptomatic; whereas others appear, grow, and regress \nwith time, which reduces the likelihood of detection and \ndiagnosis. Many patients with TSC are not diagnosed  \nuntil adulthood.\nMultiple facial angiofibromas and collagenomas have \nbeen observed in Birt\u2013Hogg\u2013Dub\u00e9 (BHD) syndrome \nand multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1). In \nthese conditions, the development of facial angiofibro -\nmas occurs later than in TSC. When angiofibromas  occur in adulthood, they should be considered a minor \nfeature and the differential diagnosis should be expanded \nto include BHD and MEN1.\nPatient Evaluation\nA detailed family history with examination of family \nmembers is required. However, 80% of cases represent de \nnovo mutations and a negative family history should not \nbe used to rule out tuberous sclerosis. Dermatologic fea -\ntures can be easily recognizable and are present in >90% \nof patients with TSC. A skin biopsy of an appropriate \nskin lesion may support the diagnosis.

The most common der -\nmatologic AEs include alopecia, morbilliform eruptions, perifollicular erythema and scaling, HFS, nail changes, and photo/radiation recall dermatitis.\nEtoposide and teniposide are common components \nof chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies and many solid tumors. Alopecia, flushing, burning erythema on the face, upper back and chest, and mucositis are com-mon. Rare dermatologic AEs include erythema multi -\nforme-like eruptions SJS/TEN, hyperpigmentation, and radiation recall dermatitis.\nMitoxantrone is indicated for advanced hormone-\nrefractory prostate cancer and acute non-lymphocytic leukemia in adults. The most common dermatologic AEs include alopecia, mucositis, and nail bed changes. Imme-diate hypersensitivity reactions, including urticaria and angioedema, have been reported.\nAntimicrotubule Agents\nTaxanes\nPaclitaxel and docetaxel are derived from the bark of the \n pacific yew tree ( Taxus brevifolia ), and needles of the Europe -\nan yew tree ( Taxus baccata ), respectively. They disrupt  normal  \nmicrotubule functions by rigidifying guanosine diphosphate-bound tubulin units. They have been used for head and  \nneck squamous cell carcinoma, advanced breast, NSCLC, gastric adenocarcinoma, and prostate and ovarian cancers.\nHSRs are a major AE, characterized by respiratory \ndistress, hypotension, angioedema, urticaria, and morbil -\nliform erythemas. Symptoms may manifest during the first \nfew minutes of infusion, and present in a dose-  dependent  \npattern. Interestingly, the solvents used in taxane formula -\ntions (e.g., Cremophor EL\u00ae and Tween 80\u00ae) are thought \nto contribute to immediate hypersensitivity reactions. In contrast, a new formulation of paclitaxel, the nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab) paclitaxel, is solvent free and not as -\nsociated with these reactions. Premedication consisting of dexamethasone, cimetidine, and diphenhydramine can re-duce the incidence of immediate hypersensitivity reactions by 20%, but cannot abrogate them completely. Therefore, \nclose monitoring during the first 5  minutes of infusion is  \nrecommended. A 12-step slow infusion method may be ad -\nopted to minimize the incidence of these reactions.\nAlopecia is a common dermatologic AE of paclitaxel \nand docetaxel use. Scalp cooling to a level \u226425 \u00b0C, prior \nto and during infusion, has been shown to be effective in preventing hair loss. Nail changes, mostly presenting as subungual hemorrhages, hyperkeratosis, paronychia, on -\nycholysis, hyperpigmentation ( Fig. 18-3), and cessation  \nof nail growth are common. The incidence of grade  \n3 nail changes is high, however, it is dependent on  \ncumulative dose and number of treatment cycles.

Patients with inflammatory hemorrhage may show leukocytoclas -\ntic vasculitis, characterized by the presence of at least some neutrophils in and around vessel walls, the presence of perivascular nuclear dust (representing degenerated neutrophil nuclei), and fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel wall. This is the histologic correlate of most forms of necrotizing vasculitis. Other types of inflammatory hem-orrhage, such as erythema multiforme, may have rela-tively few neutrophils in an infiltrate composed largely of mononuclear cells. Syndromes of bland occlusion or thrombus typically include multiple dermal vessels oc -\ncluded by pink to hyaline material with intermingled red cells, perivascular extravasation of red cells, and often little to no inflammation in early lesions.\nUnderstanding the differences in lesional evolution \nbetween these processes is essential in the correct in -\nterpretation of clinical and biopsy findings. The earliest lesions of leukocytoclastic vasculitis might have much more erythema than hemorrhage, with early signs of neutrophil-rich inflammation, and significant remaining components of the immune complexes that triggered the lesion. A later stage of the lesion might have comparable degrees of purpura and erythema, a full-blown fibrinoid necrosis on biopsy, but total destruction or removal of the inciting immune complexes in the vessel wall. A resolving lesion would have little or no erythema and a nonspecific inflammatory infiltrate.\nBy contrast, bland occlusion syndromes typically be -\ngin with little inflammation, prominent hemorrhage, and propagation of a clot within vessels; significant necrosis may develop later, followed by a wound-healing response \nof nonspecific inflammation. Ulcers from any cause may have features of secondary leukocytoclastic vasculitis at their margins. Choosing an appropriate lesion to biopsy is essential for a proper diagnosis. Fundamental to this appropriate selection is recognizing the distinct clinical evolution of lesions that result from different pathogenic processes.\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\nThe differential diagnosis of purpura is extensive, some -\ntimes confusing, and usually challenging.

Although the cutaneous \npresentation may resemble urticaria, lesions of UV are often \npainful more than pruritic, typically persist for 24 hours, and \nresolve with faint residual pigmentation ( Fig. 4-5 ).\nThe mean age at diagnosis of HUV is 40 years with \na predominance in women.

Patients with recalcitrant \nwounds may have considerable benefit if they are referred \nto a multispecialty wound care or wound healing center, \nwhere many specialists and state-of-the-art therapies are \navailable.\nPain Management\nIn general, pain management is an often neglected as -\npect of wound care. Many leg ulcerations are associated \nwith disabling pain that consequently affects activi -\nties of daily living and disrupts sleep. Because chronic \nwounds may persist for months or years, patients can \ndevelop a chronic pain syndrome. For patients with \nvenous ulcerations, quality-of-life measures, men -\ntal health, and social function are reduced compared with age-equivalent scores. A flurry of recent publi -\ncations, primarily from the nursing literature, have  \ndescribed the inadequacy of prevalent pain manage -\nment protocols and revived interest in pain manage -\nment for chronic wounds. However, no evidence-based \nstudies have been conducted to date.\nSometimes, simply covering a wound with a mois -\nturizing dressing can reduce pain substantially. Topi -\ncal analgesics such as lidocaine also may be  effective. \nSystemic and local measures may be taken to control \npain.\nManagement of Arterial Ulcerations\nThe goals of treatment of ischemic ulcers are to relieve \npain, establish adequate circulation, and prevent amputa -\ntion. This can only be achieved by providing an increase \nin blood supply; therefore the presence of an ischemic \nulcer is an indication for intervention. Patients should be \nreferred to vascular surgery or interventional radiology \nto be evaluated for potential surgical or endovascular re -\nvascularization. Any reversible risk factor should be con -\ntrolled, and exercise should be encouraged to promote \nthe development of collateral circulation. Many ischemic \nulcerations are precipitated by trauma, so the patient \nshould therefore be given detailed instructions regarding \ncare of the lower limbs. Regular use of analgesics may be \nrequired to relieve ischemic pain.\nPercutaneous balloon angioplasty or stent placement \nand laser angioplasty are used in conjunction with surgi -\ncal revascularization. In the event of failure or presence \nof progressive gangrene or severe rest pain amputation of \nthe involved limb may be necessary.\nIf the patient is not a candidate for revascularization, \nor if ischemia is not causing severe pain or gangrene,  \narterial ulcerations can be managed conservatively.\nThe use of systemic agents to promote healing of arte -\nrial ulcerations remains controversial. Pentoxifylline, ci -\nlostazol, and certain prostaglandins have been advocated \nin some patients but have limited evidence.\nAcknowledgment\nThe editors would like to acknowledge Mark D.P.",

This cytoplasmic plaque interacts with the intracellular scaffolding of tonofila -\nments and anchors the keratin intermediate filaments to the hemidesmosome. The extracellular portion of the desmosome is comprised of desmogleins and desmocol -\nlins, which project onto the cell surface of the keratino -\ncyte and contact desmosomal proteins of neighboring keratinocytes. Disruption of desmosomal interactions leads to acantholysis.\nHemidesmosomes attach basal keratinocytes to the \nunderlying basement membrane. Together with the basement membrane zone (BMZ), hemidesmosomes form the dermoepidermal junction. Proteins that com -\nprise the hemidesmosome are the bullous pemphigoid antigens 1 (BP230) and 2 (BP180), plectin, and \u03b16\u03b24 \nintegrin. BPAG1 is a 230-kDa intracellular molecule, whereas the 180-kDa BPAG2 is an anchoring filament that spans the keratinocyte extracellular membrane, ex -\ntending into the BMZ. Disruption of hemidesmosomal interactions is implicated in bullous pemphigoid, pem -\nphigoid (herpes) gestationis (discussed in Chapter 35), and linear IgA bullous dermatosis. The BMZ is divided into the lamina lucida and lamina densa, named accord -\ning to their transmission electron microscopic appear -\nance. Anchoring filaments extend from the hemidesmo-some through the lamina lucida to the lamina densa, where they interact with collagen IV and laminin 332 . \nThe papillary dermis attaches to the BMZ by anchor -\ning fibrils, which either extend from the lamina densa down to dermal anchoring plaques, or loop back up to reattach to the lamina densa. Anchoring fibrils are composed of collagen VII. The blistering in the epider -\nmolysis bullosa acquisita is thought to be due to disrup -\ntion of molecular interactions in this region. Important structural proteins in the dermis include types I and II collagen and elast in.\nPEMPHIGUS\nPemphigus is characterized by detachment of adhesions between keratinocytes (acantholysis). This process results in vesicles, bullae, and subsequent erosions of both cuta-neous and mucosal surfaces. Affected skin in pemphigus vulgaris reveals flaccid blisters that generally develop on CHAPTER 16\nBullous  Diseases\nAnneli R. Bowen  \u2022  John J. Zone\nKEY POINTS\n \u2022  Immunobullous diseases are a complicated \nmultisystem management challenge requiring \nadvanced immunosuppressive regimens.\n \u2022  Pathogenesis has been linked to disease-specific \nautoantibodies to structural antigens within the epidermis and basement membrane zone.\n \u2022  The location of blistering, risk of subsequent \nscarring, and degree of systemic involvement depend upon the type and distribution of antigen \ntargeted.\n \u2022  Clinical presentation, histologic findings, and \nimmunofluorescence studies (both indirect and \ndirect) are the cornerstone of diagnosis.\n \u2022  Treatment of pemphigus and pemphigoid includes \nsystemic steroids, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and rituximab, as well as IVIg or \nplasmapheresis for refractory cases.\n \u2022  Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is notoriously  \nrefractory to treatment, but may respond to \nmanagement similar to that of bullous pemphigoid."
