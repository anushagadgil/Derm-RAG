The dermato -\nlogic AE profile of these agents, however, continues to emerge and awaits further characterization.\nOther Anticancer Agents\nBesides cytotoxic agents and targeted therapies, a vari-ety of other drugs, such as endocrine-based therapies, \nl-asparaginase, bleomycin, and thalidomide, represent \nimportant members of the oncologic armamentarium. Their dermatologic AE profiles vary greatly and are dis -\ncussed below.\nEndocrine Agents\nEndocrine and endocrine-based therapies are used for \nthe treatment of advanced (metastatic) cancer, especially in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings. Hot flashes, hyperhidrosis, pruritus, allergic reactions, injection site reactions, and alopecia may be encountered, albeit rela -\ntively infrequently.\nSelective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs)\nTamoxifen and other SERMs ( toremifene, raloxifene) \nare used in the treatment of estrogen-receptor-positive (ER-positive) cancers. Mild flushing, as a result of estro -\ngen deprivation, is common with tamoxifen (incidence, 38.6% to 40.9%), but less frequent with other SERMs. The incidence of all-grade and grade 2 alopecia with tamoxifen is estimated to be 9.3% and 6.4%, respectively.\nEstrogen Receptor Downregulators\nEstrogen receptor downregulators (e.g., fulvestrant) an-\ntagonize the ER and result in its degradation. They are used in the treatment of ER-positive metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Hot flashes can occur in up to 21% of treated patients, while all-grade alopecia (incidence of about 7.9%), injection site reactions, and vaginitis occur less frequently.\nAromatase Inhibitors\nThe highly selective aromatase inhibitors exemestane, \nanastrozole, and letrozole exert their action by prevent -\ning the synthesis of estrogen, and are thus indicated in the treatment of ER-positive breast cancers. They commonly cause hot flashes, morbilliform eruptions, alopecia, and pruritus. The alopecia encountered could be all-grade (anastrozole, 2.5%; letrozole, 2.5%; exemestane, 2.2%), or grade 2 (letrozole, 0.2%; exemestane, 1.3%) in sever -\nity. The incidence is higher (all-grade, 14.7%) in patients who receive anastrozole after treatment with tamoxifen. In addition, exemestane is associated with cutaneous eruptions (both acneiform and a nonspecific \u201callergic\u201d type) and hypertrichosis.",

Even jaundice, classi -\ncally associated with liver immaturity (neonatal jaundice) \nor failure, may occur with hemolysis and in the setting of \nperfectly normal hepatic function. The cutaneous chang -\nes of hepatic disease may be related to primary diseases of \nthe liver; to cutaneous diseases with associated hepatic ab -\nnormalities; and to a wide variety of disorders with chang -\nes in many organs, including the liver and skin. A number \nof systemically administered drugs commonly used for \nthe treatment of cutaneous disease may produce hepatic \ndamage, including methotrexate, ketoconazole, itra -\nconazole, terbinafine, retinoids, and vitamin A. Finally,  \nseveral drugs produce hypersensitivity reactions charac -\nterized by fever, lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia, hepati -\ntis, and cutaneous eruptions, which can result in severe liver damage. This drug reaction has been known by vari -\nous terms, but most commonly is referred to as drug reac-\ntion with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). \nDrugs in this category include phenytoin, phenobarbital, \ncarbamazepine, dapsone, minocycline, and allopurinol, \namong others (see Chapter 47).\nClassically, cutaneous manifestations have been asso -\nciated with primary hepatic diseases including alcoholic \n cirrhosis and hemochromatosis, but other disorders, in -\ncluding Wilson\u2019s disease, viral hepatitis, and primary \nbiliary cirrhosis, have associated cutaneous findings. Por -\nphyria cutanea tarda and erythropoietic protoporphyria, \nknown primarily for their cutaneous manifestations, are \nassociated with hepatic abnormalities (see Chapter 28).  \nPatients with porphyria cutanea tarda have frequently been \nfound to have hepatitis C virus infection. Gianotti\u2013Crosti \nsyndrome was originally thought to be associated with viral \nhepatitis, but this association may be more prevalent only \nin southern Europe. Lichen planus, particularly oral lichen \nplanus, has also been associated with hepatitis C infection. \nMiscellaneous diseases that affect many organ systems and \ninvolve the liver and the skin include syphilis, sarcoidosis, \nGaucher\u2019s disease, polyarteritis nodosa, and cytophagic his -\ntiocytic panniculitis. Many of these disorders are discussed \nelsewhere in this book, and others occur too infrequently \nto be discussed in detail here.\nCutaneous symptoms, such as pruritus and jaundice, \nmay be important evidence for considering the diagnosis \nof hepatic disease, especially in conjunction with nonspe -\ncific symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia, vomiting and \nweight loss, diminished libido, and right upper quadrant \nabdominal discomfort. In addition to these symptoms, \ncertain physical findings, especially when considered col -\nlectively, suggest the diagnosis of hepatic disease. Muco -\ncutaneous lesions are often prominent and include scleral \nicterus, spider telangiectases, palmar erythema, excoria -\ntions (e.g., neurotic excoriations and prurigo nodularis), \nxanthelasma, alopecia, nail lesions, gynecomastia, and \nprominence of the cutaneous veins in the epigastrium. \nAny patient with symptoms of pruritus and/or findings \nof neurotic excoriations or prurigo nodularis ( Fig. 30-1 ) \nin the absence of a primary cutaneous disease should be \nevaluated for liver disease.\nCIRRHOSIS\nCirrhosis of the liver implies an irreversible alteration \nof the liver\u2019s architecture, consisting of hepatic fibrosis,  \nareas of nodular regeneration, and a loss of a considerable \nnumber of hepatocytes.

It affects up to 20% of the population at some \npoint and occurs across the age spectrum. Wheals are well-\ndemarcated swelling of the superficial dermis surrounded \nby a reflex erythema ( Fig. 10-1 , A). The size and num -\nber of the lesions vary. It is associated with an itching or  \nburning sensation. Lesions typically come and go within \n24 hours, although the overall condition may persist with \nfresh crops of wheals occurring in other areas. Angio -\nedema is characterized by sudden pronounced swelling \nin the deeper dermis, subcutaneous or submucosal tis -\nsue. It appears as brawny nonpitting edema. It is less well \ndemarcated than wheals and often painful rather than \npruritic. It lasts for 2 to 3 days. Lips, tongues, eyelids, \ngenitalia, and rarely bowels are affected ( Fig. 10-1 , B).\nAcute urticaria is defined as occurrence of spontaneous \nwheals, angioedema, or both for less than 6 weeks. If an \nallergic cause is suggested by the patient\u2019s history, such as \nmedications or food, occasionally skin testing or immu -\nnoassays to identify the triggers for acute urticaria can be \nuseful. It is important to exclude anaphylaxis in patients \npresenting with acute urticaria, as they may have com -\nmon triggers. Involvement of respiratory (wheezing and \ncough), gastrointestinal (diarrhea and vomiting), neu -\nrologic (dizziness and loss of consciousness), or cardiac (change in heart rate and blood pressure) systems are  \nconcerning and could progress to anaphylaxis.\nEpisodes of urticaria and/or angioedema lasting longer \nthan 6 weeks are designated as chronic. Duration can vary \nfrom months to many years. In 90% to 97% of patients \nwith chronic urticaria, the cause is found. Fifty percent \nof patients with chronic urticaria for 6 months will have \nactive disease 10 years later.\nPATHOGENESIS\nUrticaria and angioedema may be a final common pathway \nfor a number of immunologic or nonimmunologic reac -\ntions that lead to cutaneous vasodilatation with extravasa -\ntion of edema fluid in response to perivascular inflamma -\ntion. It is believed that the vascular reaction in most patients \nwith urticaria results from the release of proinflammatory \nmediators from mast cells and basophils. The most impor -\ntant mediator is histamine. Others include heparin, trypt -\nase, platelet-activating factor, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, \neosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis, neutrophil \nchemotactic factor, serotonin, and cytokines, such as tumor \nnecrosis factor-alpha (TNF- \u03b1). Mediators produce vascular \npermeability with extravasation of plasma into the dermis or \nsubcutaneous tissue. The delayed reaction produces tissue \ninfiltration with eosinophils, neutrophils, and monocytes.\nIgE-mediated immediate hypersensitivity reaction is a \nclassical mechanism of mast cell activation. IgE antibody \nis produced in response to an antigen. IgE binds to mast \ncell or basophil Fc receptors. Exposure to the antigen  \nresults in Fab binding and crosslinking of IgE molecules, \ninitiating a cascade of calcium-dependent processes that \nleads to release of proinflammatory mediators. Categories \nof antigen that may produce urticaria by a presumed IgE-\ndependent mechanism are listed in Table 10-1 . Physical \nstimuli may produce antigens that react with IgE and lead \nto the release of mast cell-derived mediators, giving rise \nto a subtype of urticaria, physical urticaria.\nImmunologically mediated urticaria may also occur \nvia anti-IgE and anti-Fc \u03b5RI antibodies. IgG anti-IgE \nantibody crosslinks IgE molecules, which in turn bind to \ntwo adjacent Fc receptors on mast cells. IgG anti-Fc \u03b5RI \nantibody crosslinks two adjacent Fc receptors directly \nand triggers the cascade of mast cell degranulation with -\nout allergen exposure.",

Lichenoid and rosacea-like erup -\ntions are common with oral hypoglycemic agents, which \ncause a reaction in 1% to 5% of patients. The second-\ngeneration sulfonylureas cause fewer cutaneous side ef -\nfects than first-generation agents.\nLipoatrophy is characterized by circumscribed, de -\npressed areas of skin at insulin injection sites that develop \n6 to 24 months after starting insulin. It occurs more of -\nten in children and women, and in areas of substantial fat \ndeposits, such as the thighs. Several pathogenic theories \nare proposed, including the lipolytic components of the \ninsulin preparation. Spontaneous improvement after ro -\ntating injection sites is rare, but has been reported. Use of \npurified and recombinant human insulin has resulted in \nreduced lipoatrophy. Substituting rapidly acting insulin \nmay be effective.\nLipohypertrophy is described as soft dermal nod -\nules that clinically resemble lipomas. The prevalence is \n20% to 30% in type 1 and 4% in type 2 diabetics. It is \nmore common with the use of human insulin, frequent \nnumber of injections per day, higher total daily dose of \ninsulin, reuse of needles, and missing rotation of injec -\ntion sites. It may be a response to the lipogenic action of \ninsulin. Injection into a lipohypertrophied site can lead \nto a significant delay in insulin absorption, resulting in \nerratic glucose control and unpredictable hypoglycemia. Education of patients about correct injection techniques \nand the necessity for routine change of injection sites can \nbe preventive.\nInsulin allergy is relatively rare and more commonly \nseen with bovine insulin than with porcine insulin. Re -\ncombinant DNA-produced human insulin produces less \nallergy and lipodystrophy. Documented examples of insu -\nlin allergy include immediate hypersensitivity reactions, \nwhich result in urticarial, serum sickness-like reactions, \noften characterized by vasculitic or purpuric urticarial le -\nsions, and delayed hypersensitivity reactions, which may \npresent as localized nodules.\nSUGGESTED READINGS\nAhmed I , Goldstein B .

The skin is usually less \noily, and hyperthyroidism in adolescence is associated with \na reduced incidence of acne due to decreased sebaceous \nactivity. Palmar erythema, episodic flushing over the face \nand thorax, increased capillary fragility, and persistent ery -\nthema of the elbows may also occur. Hyperhidrosis may be \neither generalized or localized to the palms and soles.\nDiffuse hair loss is present in 20% to 40% of hyper -\nthyroid patients, although the severity of alopecia does \nnot correlate with the severity of thyrotoxicosis. The hair \nitself is typically fine, soft, straight, and unable to retain a \npermanent wave. Human hair follicles are direct targets \nof thyroid hormones. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone \n(TRH), TSH, T 4, and T 3 have been associated with pro -\nliferation of matrix keratinocytes. TRH, T 3, and T 4 have \nbeen shown to stimulate intrafollicular melanin synthesis.\nNail changes, present in about 5% of cases of hy -\nperthyroidism, are often reversible following successful \ntherapy. The nails are described as rapidly growing, soft, \nand friable. Although not truly pathognomonic for thy -\nrotoxicosis, the nails often assume a \u201cscoop shovel\u201d con -\nfiguration and/or demonstrate striking onycholysis. Such \nnails are referred to as Plummer nails. Any or all the fin -\ngernails and toenails may be involved.\nPigmentary changes associated with hyperthyroidism \ninclude localized hyperpigmentation (facial, in scars, or in \npalmar creases), generalized hyperpigmentation, which \nmay be in an Addisonian pattern, canities, or vitiligo. Hy -\nperpigmentation is believed to be caused by an increased \nrelease of adrenocorticotropic hormone in compensation \nfor an accelerated rate of peripheral cortisol degrada -\ntion. Vitiligo is associated with a variety of autoimmune \ndisorders, the most frequent being autoimmune thyroid \ndisease (including both Graves\u2019 disease and Hashimoto\u2019s \nthyroiditis).\nGraves\u2019 Disease\nGraves\u2019 disease is an autoimmune disorder that develops \nas a result of susceptibility genes and presumed exposure \nto environmental factors. Age of onset is usually between 20 and 50 years and the disease occurs seven to 10 times \nmore frequently in females. To date, no unique suscep -\ntibility genes specific to pretibial myxedema or Graves\u2019 \nophthalmopathy have been identified. The hyperthyroid -\nism of Graves\u2019 disease appears to be caused by the binding \nof thyroid-stimulating autoantibodies to the TSH recep -\ntor. Activation of the TSH receptor by the autoantibody \nresults in excessive production of thyroid hormones.\nIn addition to demonstrating the nonspecific signs and \nsymptoms discussed previously, patients with Graves\u2019 dis -\nease often demonstrate several distinctive features, e.g., \npretibial myxedema (0.5% to 10%) and thyroid acropachy \n(1%). Pretibial myxedema is often, albeit not invariably, \nassociated with ophthalmopathy; 15% of those with \nophthalmopathy have associated pretibial myxedema.  \nPretibial myxedema may also be seen with Hashimoto\u2019s \nthyroiditis and Graves\u2019 disease. The status of thyroid \nfunction bears no direct relation to the development of \npretibial myxedema, and the condition may develop after \ntreatment. Although the pretibial location is most typical, \nlesions may occur on the arm, shoulder, and thigh. For \nthis reason, the term \u201cthyroid dermopathy\u201d is preferred.\nEarly lesions of pretibial myxedema appear as bi -\nlateral, raised, asymmetrical, firm plaques and nodules  \n(Fig. 25-1 ). A peau d\u2019orange appearance, caused by dermal \ninfiltration by the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) hyaluronic \nacid and chondroitin sulfate, may be noted.",

Transmission occurs by \nairborne droplets and by direct contact.Clinical Manifestations\nThe exanthem typically occurs 2 weeks after exposure, \nbegins abruptly on the head, and spreads caudally. The \nprimary lesion is an erythematous papule that evolves \ninto a clear fluid-filled vesicle on an erythematous base, \ncommonly described as a \u201cdewdrop on a rose petal\u201d  \n(Fig. 31-3 ). The vesicles subsequently evolve into pustules \nand, eventually, crusts. Additional crops occur, resulting \nin lesions in all stages of evolution presenting simultane -\nously, allowing easy differentiation from smallpox, where \nall the lesions are in the same stage of evolution. The \npalms and soles are typically spared. Vesicles and ero -\nsions are often present on the palate. Mild constitutional \nsymptoms often accompany the exanthem and are more \nprominent with increasing age. In children, varicella is \ntypically a self-limited disease but may be complicated \nby secondary infection. Primary infection in adults or \nin immunocompromised hosts may be complicated by \npneumonia, encephalitis, or myocarditis. Mortality in \nadult patients is 10% when immunocompetent and 30% \nin immunosuppressed patients.

Complications included \nslow healing, extrusion of calcium particles through scars, \nand widening of surgical scars. The majority of patients \nwere highly satisfied with the results.\nHereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia\nHereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an au -\ntosomal dominant disorder characterized by vascular \ndysplasia. Telangiectases are permanent dilatations of \ncapillaries that usually blanch when pressure is applied. \nThese telangiectases begin on the mucous membranes \nof the nose and mouth during childhood. Telangiectases \nof HHT are best demonstrated by stretching the muco -\nsal surface of the lower lip between the thumb and the \nforefinger, revealing 2- to 3-mm punctate red macules \nthat may become papular with age ( Fig. 29-3 ). In young \nadults with HHT, an excess mortality has been attributed \nto HHT.\nPathogenesis\nThe prevalence of HHT is 1 per 10,000 of the popu -\nlation, which is much more common than previously \nthought. The mode of inheritance is autosomal dominant \nwith a penetrance of approximately 97%. Two molecu -\nlar subtypes of HHT are now recognized. Both HHT-1 and HHT-2 are multisystem vascular dysplasias caused \nby specific gene mutations found through linkage studies. \nThe two subtypes reported have distinctions in the sever -\nity of disease and genetic markers.\nHHT-1 is associated with a higher prevalence and in -\ncreased severity of arteriovenous malformations. These \npatients have a higher risk of developing complex vas -\ncular abnormalities in the lungs and central nervous sys -\ntem at an early age. A mutation in the endoglin ( ENG ) \ngene has been described in HHT-1. Endoglin, which is a \ntransforming growth factor- \u03b2 (TGF- \u03b2)-binding protein, \nis expressed on capillaries, veins, and arteries. The ENG  \ngene maps to chromosome 9q34.1.\nHHT-2 is associated with a milder phenotype, re -\nduced penetrance, and a later age of onset. Pulmonary \narteriovenous malformations are less common in HHT-2 \nthan in HHT-1. Activin A receptor, type II-like kinase 1  \n(ACVRL1 ) is the mutated gene described in HHT-2. \nThe ACVRL1  gene maps to chromosome 12q11-q14. \nACVRL1  is detected in highly vascularized tissues and \n expressed primarily on endothelial cells.\nHistopathologically, irregularly dilated capillaries \nand venules develop in the papillary dermis. There is a \nlack of perivascular support, including reduced pericytes, \nsmooth muscle, and elastic fibers. Abnormally large col -\nlagen bundles with irregular banding have also been de -\nscribed. Vessels with defective perivascular support are \nespecially sensitive to insult in the gastrointestinal tract, \nwhere the epithelium is not cornified.\nPresentation\nTelangiectases develop on the undersurface of the tongue \nand floor of the mouth at puberty. Spontaneous and re -\ncurrent epistaxis is the most common presentation in \nchildhood. Vascular abnormalities of the gastrointesti -\nnal, pulmonary, and nervous systems develop after the \nfourth decade of life. Telangiectatic lesions in the gas -\ntrointestinal tract cause bleeding in 20% to 30% of pa -\ntients. Onset of gastrointestinal bleeding is usually in the \nfourth to sixth decades. Peptic ulcer disease is common in \nHHT patients. Bleeding is frequently from telangiectatic \nmucosa that has spontaneously eroded.",

Such symptoms may eas -\nily be overlooked or mistakenly ascribed to aging.\nAlterations in the skin, hair, and nails occurring in \nhypothyroidism are summarized in Table 25-6 . In one \nreview, coarse skin was the most common finding, fol -\nlowed by hair loss and edema, respectively. Generalized \nmyxedema is caused by the dermal deposition of acid \nMPS (notably hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate). \nThe entire skin appears swollen, dry, waxy, and pale. \nThe cutaneous pallor is due both to vasoconstriction and \nto the increased water and MPS content in the dermis, \nwhich alters the refraction of incident light. The skin is \nalso \u201cboggy\u201d but nonpitting, especially around the eyes, \nlips, and acral portions. The skin is cool to the touch and \nmay be so xerotic that hypothyroidism may be considered \nas a cause of acquired ichthyosis. The palms and soles \nare hypohidrotic and may demonstrate a keratoderma. \nCarotenemia may also be encountered on the volar and \npalmar surfaces as a result of reduced hepatic conversion \nof \u03b2-carotene to vitamin A.\nThe hair in patients with hypothyroidism is dull, \ncoarse, and brittle. The growth rate is slowed, with \nan increase in telogen (resting) hairs. Although diffuse \nalopecia may be seen in patients with hypothyroidism, \nthe classic pattern of hair loss is the loss of the lateral \nthird of the eyebrows (madarosis). Hypertrichosis in \nassociation with hypothyroidism has been reported in \nchildren.\nThe nails are affected to some degree in 90% of all \npatients. They are typically thin, brittle, slow-growing, \nand striated (either in longitudinal or transverse fash -\nion). Onycholysis, more commonly seen in hyperthyroid \nstates, has also been reported to accompany myxedema.Congenital Hypothyroidism\nWhen the thyroid gland fails to secrete sufficient hor -\nmone in utero or during the early perinatal period, \ncongenital hypothyroidism (cretinism) occurs. This \nphenomenon appears in one of every 3000 to 4000 live \nbirths. The overwhelming majority of cases are sporadic, \nalthough some 15% are genetic, secondary to dyshor -\nmonogenesis. This disease becomes clinically apparent \nby 6 weeks of age, although no single clinical feature can \nbe said to be pathognomonic.\nThe earliest symptoms of hypothyroidism  are non -\nspecific and include lethargy, poor feeding, constipation, \npersistent neonatal jaundice, and respiratory difficulty as \na result of myxedema of the oropharynx and larynx.",

Pa \u00ad\ntients who have evidence of dysphagia should have the \nhead of the bed elevated and should avoid eating meals \nbefore retiring.\nThe overall therapeutic plan is determined primar \u00ad\nily by the presence or absence of myositis or other in \u00ad\nternal organ involvement.

Management of patients with cAITL should be \nperformed in a hematologic setting, as the disease always represents a secondary manifestation of a primary extra -\ncutaneous lymphoma.\nCutaneous Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma (HL)\nSpecific skin manifestations of HL are exceedingly rare, whereas nonspecific dermatological signs are more com -\nmon. As a rule, a diagnosis of cutaneous HL should be made only in patients with known extracutaneous dis -\nease (that means, primary cutaneous cases are extremely rare, if they exist at all). As management of patients with HL has improved considerably over the last decades, the incidence of specific skin manifestations has decreased dramatically, and nowadays they are observed only ex-ceedingly rarely. Skin involvement is found usually in the drainage area of affected lymph nodes and more rarely in a generalized fashion. Histologic examination of cu -\ntaneous infiltrates shows morphologic and phenotypic features similar to those observed in the lymph nodes. Treatment should be given according to guidelines for the nodal disease.\nNonspecific Signs of Systemic Lymphomas\nPatients with systemic lymphomas may present different skin diseases unrelated to direct colonization by neoplas -\ntic cells (that is, \u201cnonspecific\u201d cutaneous manifestations of systemic lymphomas). The most common conditions are listed in Table 20-2. These skin disorders may pre -\ncede, arise concomitant with, or follow the systemic lym -\nphoma. Some of them are very common skin conditions observed often in nonparaneoplastic settings, and thus do not represent helpful diagnostic clues. Other conditions, on the other hand, are frequently related to nodal HL or other non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphomas (NHLs), and may represent useful clues for diagnosis and/or monitoring of disease activity.\nPruritus is a very common cutaneous symptom and \ncan be associated with myriads of cutaneous and systemic disorders. Chronic pruritus without evidence of skin le -\nsions (\u201cpruritus sine materia\u201d) may be a cutaneous sign of HL or NHL, and can antedate the diagnosis of the nodal disease by several months or years. Although idiopathic pruritus may be observed also in several other conditions unrelated to hematologic malignancies, screening for an underlying lymphoma belongs to the standard manage -\nment of these patients.\nSweet\u2019s syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic derma -\ntosis) is characterized by the sudden onset of tender or painful cutaneous erythematous, edematous papules, or plaques accompanied by fever, malaise, and neutrophilic leukocytosis. Systemic symptoms are not invariably pres -\nent, and several clinicopathologic variants have been  \ndescribed. Sweet\u2019s syndrome may be associated with  \nmalignancies, particularly ML or MDS (10% to 15% of cases). In some cases neoplastic cells may be observed within the inflammatory infiltrate, particularly in some variants of the disease (e.g., \u201chistiocytoid\u201d Sweet\u2019s syn-drome). Sweet\u2019s syndrome may also be associated with the use of colony-stimulating factors and with several other neoplastic and non-neoplastic disorders. In absence of other signs and/or symptoms, extensive screening in -\nvestigations in search of an underlying hematologic dis -\norder are not necessary (with the possible exception of histiocytoid Sweet\u2019s syndrome).\nPyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is characterized by \nthe rapid development of pustules evolving into large, undermined ulcerative lesions, often following minor trauma or after surgical procedures (so-called \u201cpather -\ngy\u201d). In some cases, PG may be associated with hema -\ntologic malignancies (particularly ML and variants). In these patients lesions may have a bullous appearance and may show overlapping features with bullous Sweet\u2019s syn -\ndrome. As for Sweet\u2019s syndrome, for patients with PG ex -\ntensive screening investigations in search of an underly -\ning hematologic disorder are not necessary if other signs and/or symptoms are not present (bullous PG, though, is more frequently associated with hematologic malignan -\ncies than other variants of the disease, and these patients should be screened more carefully).\nParaneoplastic pemphigus is an autoimmune blis -\ntering disorder mainly associated with NHLs (particu -\nlarly B-cell NHLs and leukemias, but also other types, as well as thymoma and Castleman\u2019s disease). It is char -\nacterized by polymorphous skin lesions with features of both erythema multiforme and pemphigus vulgaris.",

Diabetic \ncheiroarthropathy can be particularly challenging to dif -\nferentiate from sclerodactyly due to thickening of peri -\narticular skin as well as subcutaneous tissues; the typical \nulnar to radial progression, initially involving the 5th and \n4th digits, can be a helpful clue.\nThe differential diagnosis of other, nonsclerotic skin \nmanifestations of SSc becomes particularly important \nwhen cutaneous sclerosis is subtle. Telangiectases are \ncommonplace skin lesions, appearing with conditions \nas diverse as rosacea, photoaging, and liver disease. The \ntelangiectases of SSc, frequently referred to as \u201cmat\u201d \ntelangiectases, have a characteristic flat, square, or mat-\nlike appearance and frequently involve the oral mucosa, \nhelping to distinguish them from other etiologies. While \nhereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia can present with \nprominent mucosal telangiectases, they tend to be more \nrounded and raised.\nManagement\nAs there is no cure for SSc, management is directed \ntoward limiting the impact of individual disease mani -\nfestations, often with the help of several specialists and \nmanifestation-specific medications.\nSkin Manifestations . Trials addressing the cutaneous \nsclerosis associated with SSc have generally been met with \nlimited success. The European League Against Rheuma -\ntism recommends methotrexate (e.g., 15 to 25 mg weekly) \nas a first-line treatment based on two randomized con -\ntrolled trials that have shown methotrexate to modestly \nimprove skin scores in early dSSc. If there is inadequate \nresponse, expert opinion would support adding or switch -\ning to mycophenolate mofetil. There are also trial data \nto support the use of oral or IV cyclophosphamide for \nsevere disease. Both PUVA and UVA-1 may help with \ncutaneous sclerosis in SSc and are favored over UVB due \nto deeper penetration. Hand phototherapy and occupa -\ntional therapy may be helpful for maintaining hand func -\ntion in the presence of sclerodactyly. In addition, many \npatients with SSc have severe multifactorial pruritus, \nparticularly early in the disease course; treatment consid -\nerations include agents targeting neuropathic pain (e.g., \ngabapentin), opioid antagonists (e.g., naltrexone), as well \nas agents aimed at treating the cutaneous sclerosis itself.\nNonsclerotic skin manifestations are best addressed \nindividually. Telangiectases generally respond well \nto vascular laser. Calcinosis cutis typically remains re -\nsistant to treatment. For discussion of the manage -\nment of Raynaud\u2019s and digital ulcers, see the separate section dedicated to Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon later in \nthis chapter.\nSystemic Manifestations . Cardiopulmonary and other \nend-organ involvement in SSc is often managed in an in -\nterdisciplinary manner. All providers can make a major \ncontribution by ensuring patients are screened appropri -\nately. Screening for ILD is invaluable as disease is often \nasymptomatic until late in its course, and treatment (e.g., \nmycophenolate mofetil) has been shown to improve sur -\nvival. Basic screening for ILD includes pulmonary function \ntests (PFTs) with DLCO every 6 to 12 months. Findings \nof a low DLCO and/or a restrictive pattern should trig -\nger further workup for ILD, including a  high-resolution \nchest computed tomography (CT). In addition to PFTs, \nsome experts advocate a baseline  high-resolution chest \nCT.",

The mainstay of therapy for BP is parenteral corticosteroids. Oral \nprednisone, 40 to 60  mg daily, is generally adequate for \ninitial treatment, and may be the only treatment neces -\nsary. With this agent, individual blisters generally resolve \nwithin 2 to 3  weeks and new blister formation ceases. A \nmajor complication of treatment is related to cortico -\nsteroid side effects, including increased susceptibility to infection, potential gastrointestinal bleeding, onset of diabetes mellitus, and the possible development of psy -\nchiatric symptoms. These problems may well be severe, in view of the elderly age group afflicted. Consequently, close attention to complications is necessary. Oral thera -\npy with bisphosphonates is indicated to prevent steroid-induced osteoporosis if steroids are to be used for more than a few days. Some reports suggest a beneficial effect of the combination of tetracycline and niacinamide as ini -\ntial therapy in mild cases.\nAzathioprine, 1 to 3  mg/kg/day, is an especially effec -\ntive agent when used to spare corticosteroid dosage in patients with BP. The onset of effect is slow; thus, after 4 \nto 6 weeks of treatment with azathioprine, corticosteroid \ndoses can be gradually tapered. Cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil are effective and may be used in the manner described for pemphigus.\nAs with pemphigus, IVIg appears to be effective, espe -\ncially in recalcitrant disease. Doses similar to those used in pemphigus vulgaris have been effective in some pa -\ntients, but definitive studies on its efficacy in pemphigoid are lacking.\nMucous membrane pemphigoid, if localized, may be \ntreated with topical corticosteroid preparations, but usu-ally requires systemic corticosteroid therapy. Dapsone may be helpful in controlling the oral lesions, but is of -\nten ineffective in preventing progressive ocular disease. Therapy with dapsone should be given in doses similar to those described for dermatitis herpetiformis (see later section on dermatitis herpetiformis). Eye involvement in cicatricial pemphigoid is particularly serious and warrants aggressive therapy. If initial response to oral corticoste -\nroid therapy is not forthcoming, aggressive treatment with cyclophosphamide is indicated.

However, with the exception of \nflares in the setting of IRIS, the frequency and severity \nof HIV-associated Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma are typically pro -\nportional to the patient\u2019s degree of immune impairment. \nAs a result, most patients have CD4+ T-lymphocyte \ncounts <500/mm3 and develop multicentric, progressive \ndisease ( Fig. 23-13 ).\nIn contrast to other variants of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma, ini -\ntial cutaneous lesions often develop on the face and trunk; \nin the latter location, lesions may be aligned with their \nlong axes in the direction of skin folds ( Fig. 23-13 C).

It has no age or gender bias and was even -\ntually recognized to have both skin and systemic involve -\nment. Although initially unclear, the etiology of NSF has \nbeen linked to gadolinium exposure from imaging studies \nin patients with renal insufficiency. In 2010, in addition \nto a black box warning, the Food and Drug Administra -\ntion stated that three contrast agents\u2014gadopentetate \ndimeglumine (Magnevist\u2122), gadodiamide (Omniscan\u2122), \nand gadoversetamide (OptiMARK\u2122)\u2014were contraindi -\ncated in patients with either acute or CKD. While the \nspecific mechanism is unknown, disease development is \nthought to be related to a specific cell type, a circulating \nfibrocyte, stimulated by gadolinium.\nNSF presents as rapidly progressive, symmetrically dis -\ntributed, thickened, indurated papules and plaques, often \non the extremities and trunk; early lesions may be pruritic \n(Fig. 38-6 ). As fibrosis progresses, the skin becomes teth -\nered with brawny hyperpigmentation, often resulting in \npain and joint contractures. Later, patients may develop \nepidermal atrophy, hair loss, and follicular dimpling or a \npeau d\u2019orange appearance. Fibrosis may also affect skel -\netal muscle, the diaphragm, lymph nodes, heart, lungs, \npleura, liver, thyroid, and genitourinary tract. In addition, \npatients with NSF can have yellow plaques on the sclera \nof their eyes with accompanying conjunctival injection. \nWhile NSF can be mistaken for other cutaneous scleros -\ning disorders, it lacks the facial involvement of systemic \nsclerosis or scleromyxedema. In addition, in patients with \nsystemic sclerosis, the cutaneous sclerosis tends to start \nmore distally than in patients with NSF, involving even \nthe distal fingers. Furthermore, Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon \nand nailfold capillary changes are also absent in patients \nwith NSF. Laboratory testing generally demonstrates the \nabsence of antibodies or a paraprotein often seen in con -\nnective tissue disorders or scleromyxedema, respectively. \nA deep biopsy is essential for diagnosis, revealing thick -\nened collagen bundles with few inflammatory cells and increased dermal fibroblast-like cells that stain positively \nfor CD34 and procollagen I. Particles of gadolinium can \nbe detected in some tissue specimens.\nNSF results in increased morbidity and mortality, and \npatients may suffer from debilitating contractures and \ndecreased mobility. Treatment options are limited, with \nreports of benefit with imatinib, rapamycin, UVA1 pho -\ntotherapy, intravenous immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis, \nextracorporeal photopheresis, intravenous sodium thio -\nsulfate, and renal transplantation. The implementation of \nrestrictive guidelines and avoidance of gadolinium-based \ncontrast agents in patients with CKD have greatly re -\nduced the incidence of NSF. Although not fully eradi -\ncated, NSF may soon hopefully be a disease of the past.\nPruritus-Related Skin Changes\nIntractable and severe pruritus commonly occurs in pa -\ntients with ESRD and has no association with age, sex, \nrace, or precipitating disease.

Circulating immune \ncomplexes tend to correlate with vasculitis, active renal dis -\nease, arthritis, or serositis. They may be pathogenetically \nimportant in vasculitis and renal involvement, but are prob -\nably not involved in the pathogenesis of the nonvasculitic \ncutaneous lesion. Complement activation is also a feature \nof SLE, and hypocomplementemia correlates with active \nsystemic disease. Patients with persistent hypocomple -\nmentemia should be evaluated for complement component \ndeficiencies, of which C2 deficiency is the most common.\nCutaneous immunofluorescence applied as a diagnostic \nand prognostic tool has led to a better understanding of \nLE.

This \ntesting is costly, but if all results are negative, the value \nof the assurance that can be given regarding the benign \nnature of the disease process is inestimable.\nThe goals of management of cutaneous LE are to sup -\npress disease activity, improve the patient\u2019s appearance, \nand prevent the development of deforming scars, atrophy, \nor dyspigmentation. Few randomized clinical trials have \nbeen performed, and hence the response to all therapies has largely been determined only by a global assessment \nby the treating physician. An outcomes measure specific \nto cutaneous lupus, the Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus \nDisease Area and Severity Index (CLASI), has been de -\nveloped by Werth and colleagues. This tool can be used \nto quantify disease activity and damage over time, and has \nnow been used in multiple clinical trials to demonstrate \ntreatment response for existing and novel therapies.\nThe most important therapeutic intervention ( Table \n1-7) is the use of sunscreens, photoprotective cloth -\ning and wide-brimmed hats, and sun avoidance.

Focal vasculitis may be seen but should \nnot be prominent.\nAssociated Conditions\nThere is an associated systemic disease in roughly 50% \nof patients with PG ( Table 5-2 ). The most common \n associated conditions are IBD, arthritis, paraproteinemia, \nand hematologic malignancy. Work-up for an associated \ndisease is an important part of the evaluation for a patient \ndiagnosed with PG.\nArthritis is a frequent finding in patients with PG. In \ngeneral, the arthritis associated with PG is a symmetrical \npolyarthritis, which may be seronegative or seropositive. \nAs described with Sweet\u2019s syndrome, patients with PG \nmay also have neutrophilic infiltration of internal organs, \nincluding the lung, liver, heart, and bone.\nTreatment\nTreatment for PG must be directed at optimization of \nwound healing and control of inflammation. Wound \ncare includes selecting appropriate dressings, monitoring for and treating infection, and minimizing exacerbating \nfactors. Strategies for controlling inflammation are var -\nied and depend on the number and size of lesions, rate \nof progression, and presence of associated underlying \ndisorders.\nIn mild cases, local measures such as topical agents in -\ncluding corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, or topical \ndapsone, or intralesional injections may be sufficient to \ncontrol disease. In patients with severe or rapidly pro -\ngressive disease, systemic corticosteroids and cyclospo -\nrine are generally considered first-line therapies. For \npatients with PG associated with IBD, corticosteroid-\nsparing strategies are generally preferred and biologics \nare becoming the treatment of choice to control both \nthe skin and gut disease. Infliximab and adalimumab have \nshown efficacy in patients with PG and IBD, the former \nin a randomized placebo-controlled trial. Other agents \nincluding azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, intrave -\nnous immunoglobulin, anakinra, canakinumab, and cy -\nclophosphamide have been used for refractory disease or \nin patients who develop side effects to other therapies. \nFinally, agents such as dapsone and minocycline may be \nconsidered as adjunctive or maintenance treatments.\nBOWEL-ASSOCIATED DERMATOSIS\u2013\nARTHRITIS SYNDROME\nClinical Manifestations\nBowel-associated dermatosis\u2013arthritis syndrome is char -\nacterized by recurrent crops of cutaneous pustular vascu -\nlitis, synovitis, fever, and flu-like symptoms that develop \nsubsequent to a variety of bariatric procedures or with \nIBD. The incidence of this syndrome was initially report -\ned to be as high as 20% after jejunoileal bypass surgery, \nthough it is generally considered to be less common with \nmore modern bariatric procedures. Patients experience \nthe onset of the serum sickness-like illness typically 2 to \n3 months, but ranging from several days to years, after the \ngastrointestinal procedure. An increased frequency of di -\narrhea and gastrointestinal disturbance accompanies the \nsystemic disease. Polyarticular arthralgias, myalgias, and \na nonerosive arthritis are frequent findings. Cutaneous \npustular vasculitis is frequently seen, though erythema \nnodosum-like lesions may also occur ( Fig. 5-8 ).

Some treatment considerations with respect to dis -\nease subtype are as follows.\nCircumscribed Morphea . Topical corticosteroid \nmonotherapy is a common initial approach to treating \ncircumscribed morphea in practice; while topical cor -\nticosteroids alone may indeed be beneficial, there are \npresently no data to specifically support this. Topical ta -\ncrolimus resulted in improved skin thickness in a small \nrandomized controlled trial and is another reasonable \napproach. If lesions are unresponsive, other options in -\nclude topical imiquimod, topical calcipotriene, a combi -\nnation of calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate, \nor lesion-limited phototherapy (NB-UVB, UVA, or \nUVA-1). The accessibility and limited toxicity of NB-\nUVB make it a favorable initial form of phototherapy \nfor many patients. Patients with deeper or recalcitrant \ndisease may benefit from a UVA-based regimen\u2014ex -\ncimer laser.\nLinear Morphea . Both prospective and retrospective data \nsupport the efficacy of methotrexate (e.g., 15 to 25 mg/\nweek in adults, 1 mg/kg per week in children) in combina -\ntion with systemic steroids (e.g., prednisone 1 mg/kg PO \ndaily or IV pulse with or without subsequent oral predni -\nsone taper) in the treatment of morphea ( Fett and Werth, \n2011b ). In children with linear morphea, methotrexate \nplus systemic corticosteroids is the standard of care and is \nsupported by data from a randomized placebo-controlled \ntrial. If there is no improvement after 8 to 12 weeks, addi -\ntion of or transition to phototherapy (UVA1 or PUVA for \ndeeper lesions and a trial of NB-UVB for superficial le -\nsions) or mycophenolate mofetil can be pursued. Pediatric \nrheumatologists frequently add mycophenolate mofetil \nin addition to methotrexate in refractory cases. Notably, \nassessing treatment response can be very challenging in \ncases of linear morphea. Appropriate counseling is critical \nin that the first goal of therapy is to halt disease progres -\nsion; tissue that has already been damaged will not return \nto normal and should not lead to increasing the patient\u2019s \ntreatment regimen. Reconstructive surgery can be con -\nsidered for disfiguring facial atrophy, provided the disease \nhas been quiescent for several years. Surgical intervention \nduring active disease has caused rapid progression in in -\ndividual patients.\nGeneralized Morphea . Phototherapy is typically con -\nsidered first-line treatment for generalized morphea if \nthe patient does not have functional limitations. If there \nis no response after 8 weeks, a combination of methotrex -\nate and systemic corticosteroids can be implemented. If \nthere is no improvement after an additional 8 to 12 weeks, \nmycophenolate mofetil can be considered.\nSystemic Sclerosis\nClinical Manifestations\nSystemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune connective \ntissue disease characterized by vascular dysfunction, au -\ntoimmunity, and sclerosis of end organs including skin. While SSc is most prevalent in middle-aged women, it \ncan occur at all ages and in both genders. The etiopatho -\ngenesis likely involves both genetic and environmental \nfactors. Disease subtypes include: (1) limited cutaneous \nsystemic sclerosis (formerly known as CREST, i.e., cal -\ncinosis, Raynaud\u2019s, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, \ntelangiectasia); (2) diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis; \n(3) overlap syndromes, including mixed connective tissue \ndisease (discussed separately at the end of this chapter); \nand (4) systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma (lacking skin \ninvolvement).\nDiffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (dSSc) and lim -\nited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (lSSc) are the most \nwell-recognized clinical patterns of disease, differenti -\nated based on the extent of skin involvement.",

In addition, the ulcerated surface of a chancre pro -\nvides a portal of entry for the HIV. The clinical course of \nearly syphilis in patients with AIDS is often as described \nabove; however, there are reports of more aggressive dis -\nease (lues maligna), an increased frequency of serologi -\ncally defined treatment failures, an increased risk for the \ndevelopment of neurosyphilis, and a higher relapse rate \nof neurosyphilis following penicillin therapy. Rarely, a \nnonreactive RPR has been observed at the onset of the \nsecondary phase in HIV-infected patients. Lastly, HIV \ninfection is one of the causes of a chronic false-positive \nRPR. Recently, several studies documented that syphi -\nlis may also impact the course of HIV infection. These \nstudies suggest that syphilis, like many other acute in -\nfections, causes transient increases in the viral load and \ndecreases in the CD4 cell count that resolve after the in -\nfection is treated.\nChancroid\nAs with syphilis, the primary mode of transmission for \nchancroid is intimate contact. Therefore, those with \nmultiple sexual partners are at highest risk for developing \nthis infectious disease. The etiologic agent is the Gram-\nnegative bacterium H. ducreyi . Cutaneous ulcers of chan -\ncroid appear in the genital region (primarily on the penis \nand vulva) approximately 3 to 7 days following exposure. \nIn contrast to syphilis, there are usually multiple lesions \n(Fig. 35-28 ), including kissing lesions. The ulcers range \nin size from 2 mm to 3 cm and have irregular, overhang -\ning borders that are sometimes referred to as \u201cshaggy\u201d; \nthe ulcers are painful and tender to palpation, but soft. \nTender prominent lymphadenopathy and abscesses (re -\nferred to as buboes) are frequently seen.\nConfirmation of the clinical diagnosis of chancroid re -\nquires a bacterial culture and Gram stain of material ob -\ntained by swabbing the base of the ulcer and undersurface of \nthe edges. Parallel linear arrays of Gram-negative rods can \nbe seen on Gram stain, and have been likened to a school \nof fish. H. ducreyi  is fastidious and requires culture on spe -\ncialized media supplemented with serum and hemoglobin. \nPCR-based identification of organisms is now available.\nThe appropriate therapy is outlined in Table 35-2 . \nAs with syphilis, the differential diagnosis includes the \ntwo most common causes of genital ulcers: herpes sim -\nplex and trauma. However, when the ulcers are chronic \nand nonhealing, then more unusual etiologies need to be excluded, such as squamous cell carcinoma, lymphoma, \ngranuloma inguinale, and Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease.\nGranuloma Inguinale\nGranuloma inguinale  is an unusual sexually transmitted \ndisease caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Klebsi -\nella granulomatis , which used to be called Calymmatobac -\nterium granulomatis . The lesions are seen primarily in \nthe genital region, and although they begin as papules, \nover time friable granulomatous plaques and ulcerations \noften attain a rather large size ( Fig. 35-29 ). As a result, \nthere is frequently destruction of normal tissues. The \nincubation period probably ranges from 2 weeks to \n3 months, and the disease is much more prevalent in de -\nveloping countries.\nThe clinical diagnosis is based on the patient\u2019s sexual \nhistory and on physical examination revealing a pain -\nless, \u201cbeefy-red ulcer\u201d with a characteristic rolled edge \nof granulation tissue.",

The most common cutaneous presentation of \nsarcoidosis is a papular lesion: small papules, erythema -\ntous-to-violaceous, 3 to 5 mm in diameter, are frequently \nnoted on the head and neck ( Fig. 36-2 ). The periorbital \nand periorificial regions are commonly involved, with le -\nsions commonly seen around the nostrils on the nares, \nand around the eyes and/or mouth ( Fig. 36-3 ). The le -\nsions may be flesh-colored, red, violaceous, or slightly hy -\nperpigmented. At times the papules enlarge or coalesce to \nform annular lesions ( Fig. 36-4 ), nodules ( Fig. 36-5 ), or \nplaques ( Fig. 36-6 ).

Most of these cutaneous lesions are smooth, nontender, cu -\ntaneous, or subcutaneous nodules, skin-colored to vi -\nolaceous, and 1 to 5  cm in diameter, and they may be  \ncrusted or ulcerated. They are usually located on the trunk, extremities, or face. All immunoglobulin classes have been associated with PCMZL, but most are IgG- or IgA-producing cells. True cutaneous plasmacytomas indicate a large tumor cell burden in patients with mul-tiple myeloma, and therefore usually occur late in the course of the disease, either as an extension from under -\nlying bone or as distinct cutaneous metastases. Although IgD myeloma is rare, patients with this disease have a higher incidence of extramedullary lesions, including cutaneous plasmacytomas (up to 18%). The IgD subset of myeloma usually develops in young men and has an aggressive course.\nA lesion of PCMZL may be an isolated finding, even \nwith long-term follow-up. Because the number of plasma cells in such a lesion is small and the amount of immuno -\nglobulin synthesized is directly related to cell numbers, such patients are unlikely to have a serum monoclonal antibody spike.

The prevalence of diabetes \nworldwide is approximately 350 million, with increased \nprevalence in industrialized nations. Diabetes is a com -\nplex, multiorgan disease that can impact nearly every or -\ngan system. Cutaneous manifestations of diabetes, which \ncan be associated with significant morbidity, are reported \nin up to 70% of patients with DM at some point during \nthe course of their disease. This chapter describes derma -\ntologic manifestations of diabetes, which is divided into \n(1) cutaneous manifestations of DM, (2) other cutaneous \nfindings in DM, (3) dermatologic diseases associated with \nDM, and (4) cutaneous complications of diabetes therapy.\nCUTANEOUS MANIFESTATIONS  \nOF DIABETES\nAcanthosis Nigricans\nDescription\nAcanthosis nigricans (AN) is a common dermatologic \nfinding seen in insulin-resistant states such as diabetes. \nIt is characterized by velvety to verrucous thickening and \nlight brown to black hyperpigmentation of the skin, found \npredominantly in intertriginous and flexural surfaces of \nthe body ( Fig. 24-1 ). Flexural areas are most commonly \naffected areas such as the neck, axillae, and submammary regions. Involvement of the palmar hands is referred to \nas tripe palms. Histologically, epidermal papillomatosis, \nhyperkeratosis, and mild acanthosis are characteristic. \nThe hyperpigmentation observed clinically relates to the \nthickness of the keratin-containing superficial epithelium, \nnot to changes in melanocytes or melanin content. AN is \nconsidered a cutaneous marker of insulin resistance, thus \nclinical diagnosis of AN warrants screening for diabetes \nand potentially other endocrinopathies.\nEpidemiology\nAlthough observed in all ethnicities, there is a higher \nprevalence among Native Americans, Hispanics, South -\neast Asians, and African-Americans. In addition to diabe -\ntes, AN can be observed as a paraneoplastic phenomenon, \nin obesity and metabolic syndrome, polycystic ovarian \nsyndrome, Cushing syndrome, and other endocrine ab -\nnormalities involving insulin resistance.\nPathogenesis\nThe precise mechanism is not fully elucidated, but hyper -\ninsulinemia may activate insulin growth factor (IGF-1) \nreceptors on keratinocytes, leading to epidermal growth \nand subsequent hyperpigmentation.\nTreatment\nLifestyle modifications such as weight reduction, dietary \nrestrictions, and physical activity are most effective in the \ncontrol and reversal of AN. Treatment of insulin resis -\ntance and optimizing glycemic and insulin balance will \nfurther improve this condition. Dermatologic therapies \ndo not have a direct benefit, but topical keratolytics such \nas salicylic acid, ammonium lactate, or retinoid acid can \nhelp alleviate symptoms and reduce thickening of the skin.\nAcquired Perforating Dermatoses\nDescription\nAcquired perforating dermatoses (APD) are a group of \nchronic skin disorders characterized by pruritic, perifol -\nlicular, hyperkeratotic, dome-shaped papules or nodules \nwith a central keratin plug. Perforating lesions can oc -\ncur anywhere, but most commonly occur on the legs and \ntrunk, and less often on the head. The eruption often \ndemonstrates koebnerization and can be exacerbated \nby excoriation. Histologically these disorders are char -\nacterized by the presence of devitalization of connec -\ntive tissue components of the dermis such as collagen, CHAPTER 24\nDiabetes  anD the skin\nChristine S.

Chronic \nhyperglycemia, which leads to formation of advanced \nglycosylation end products, oxidative stress, and neuroin -\nflammation, causes a loss of myelinated and unmyelinated \nfibers and blunted nerve production. Sensory and motor \nneuropathy can lead to foot deformities that increase the \nrisk of ulcer formation. Autonomic neuropathy can lead \nto anhidrosis in the lower extremities, causing dryness, \ncracks, and callus formation, increasing the risk for ulcer -\nation and secondary infection.\nTreatment\nNeuropathic ulcers usually heal within weeks if treated \nwith aggressive debridement and offloading with vari -\nous devices, or most effectively, with a total contact cast. \nAdherence to principles of wound-healing strategies is an \nimportant component of treatment, and there is a wide \nrange of wound-healing agents available, including saline \ndressings, impregnated gauze, hydrogels, hydrocolloids, \ncalcium alginate, silver, vacuum-assisted closure, and hy -\nperbaric oxygen. A surgical revascularization procedure \ncan correct the ischemic state. The use of topical growth \nfactors or bioengineered skin grafts may be helpful but \ncannot replace revascularization procedures, debridement, \nand ulcer offloading. Because of the prevalence of bacterial \ncolonization of ulcers, the need for antibiotic therapy rests \non clinical evaluation and judgment. Prevention of com -\nplications remains paramount through daily foot inspec -\ntion, care guidelines, and prevention of pressure, friction, \nand callus formation by the use of appropriate footwear.\nEruptive Xanthomatosis\nDescription\nEruptive xanthomas present as yellow to red papules that \nappear over weeks to months ( Fig. 24-4 ). The lesions can \nbe tender or pruritic, and may be surrounded with mild ery -\nthema. Xanthomas have a predilection for the buttocks and \nextensor surfaces of the extremities, with koebnerization noted in areas of pressure. Histologically, there is infiltra -\ntion of the dermis with lipid-laden histiocytic foam cells as \nwell as lymphocytes and neutrophils. Unlike other forms \nof xanthomas, the lipids within the macrophages represent \ntriglycerides rather than cholesterol esters.\nEpidemiology\nAlthough the prevalence of xanthomatosis is not well \ncharacterized, it is reported in less than 1% of patients \nwith noninsulin-dependent DM. Concomitant dyslipid -\nemia in addition to diabetes leads to a higher risk for de -\nveloping eruptive xanthomatosis.\nPathogenesis\nEruptive xanthomas are pathognomonic of hypertriglyc -\neridemia, and up to one-third of patients with diabetes \nhave lipoprotein abnormalities caused by low insulin lev -\nels. The low-insulin state of diabetes leads to the inabil -\nity of insulin to act as a stimulating factor for lipoprotein \nlipase, an enzyme with a role in metabolism of serum \ntriglycerides and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. With -\nout the appropriate activity of lipoprotein lipase, there is \nimpaired clearance of very- low-density lipoproteins and \nchylomicrons, which can lead to increased levels of lipids \nand may precipitate eruptive xanthomas.\nTreatment\nThe eruption improves with optimization of glycemic \ncontrol and insulin levels, and improved control of car -\nbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Treatment may also be \nsupplemented with statins and fibrates.\nNecrobiosis Lipoidica\nDescription\nNecrobiosis lipoidica (NL) is a necrotizing, granulomatous \nskin disease that is characterized by well-circumscribed, \nAB\nFIGURE 24-4  n (A) Multiple eruptive xanthomas in a patient with poorly-controlled diabetes.

Urticarial vasculitis can have \neither low or normal complement levels (C4, C3, and \nC1q). Patients with normal complement levels often \nhave skin-limited diseases. When complement levels are \ndecreased, the disease course tends to be more severe \nand persistent. In some cases this may be due to IgG \nantibodies to C1q.\nWhen recurrent angioedema occurs without wheals \nor pruritus, it is important to consider the possibility of \nC1 esterase inhibitor deficiency. C1 esterase deficiency \nis usually hereditary, but may be acquired. Hereditary \nangioedema (HAE) occurs as an autosomal dominant \ngenodermatosis caused by mutation in one copy of the \nC1 esterase inhibitor gene. It results in reduced levels \nof C1 inhibitor (type I HAE, 85% of cases) or reduced \nC1 inhibitor function (type II HAE, 15% of cases). Ac -\nquired angioedema (AAE) is due to the formation of \ninhibitory autoantibodies against C1 inhibitor, often \nin the setting of lymphoproliferative diseases, parapro -\nteinemia, or systemic lupus erythematosus. The subse -\nquent consumption of complements leads to low levels \nof C4, which is a diagnostic feature between and during \nattacks in untreated patients. Type III hereditary an -\ngioedema is a newly reported type of familial angioede -\nma with a female preponderance, where patients have \nnormal C1 esterase inhibitor levels and activity. Skin \nis the most commonly affected organ, showing painful \nand disfiguring swelling. Gastrointestinal colic, nausea, \nvomiting, and diarrhea occur in one-quarter of the at -\ntacks and are experienced at some point by most HAE \npatients. The least common (<1%) but potentially life-\nthreatening complication of upper airway attacks may \neven result in asphyxiation. Attacks usually last 48 to 72 hours and are followed by a refractory period. An -\ngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor can in -\nduce angioedema without urticaria. It is believed to be \nmediated by bradykinin as well.\nMastocytosis is frequently associated with urticarial le -\nsions (Chapter 42).\nUrticaria can be a manifestation of exercise-induced \nanaphylaxis (EIAn). There are two subgroups of patients \nwith EIAn. One group experiences anaphylaxis pro -\nvoked by exercise alone. The second group experiences \nanaphylaxis when exercise happens in temporal prox -\nimity to ingestion of food such as gluten. Cholinergic \nurticaria, a type of physical urticaria, can be associated \nwith exercise as well.",

Specifically, indeterminate cell histio-cytosis stains positive with CD1a and S100, and Rosai\u2013Dorfman stains positive with S100.

It is \noften difficult to distinguish viral exanthems from mor -\nbilliform drug eruptions; however, subtle distinguishing \nfeatures may enable differentiation.\nMEASLES (RUBEOLA)\nMeasles (rubeola) is caused by a single-stranded RNA \nparamyxovirus. Transmission occurs via respiratory secre -\ntions. Routine administration of live attenuated vaccine is \ncurrently recommended by the Centers for Disease Con -\ntrol and Prevention (CDC) for all infants, college entrants, \nand medical personnel without serologic evidence of past infection. The incidence of measles infection has decreased \ndramatically with the introduction of widespread vaccina -\ntion; however, a gradual increase has occurred in recent \nyears in the United States. Some of those affected were  \npreviously vaccinated, although more parents are choosing \nnot to vaccinate,  resulting in increasing numbers of small \nbut significant local outbreaks. However, the health benefits \nof vaccinations far outweigh the unfounded concerns about \nthe potential adverse effects based on scientifically discred -\nited concerns with no medical basis. Two distinct forms of \nthe disease are modified measles, which occurs when an \nindividual is infected when they have passive immunity \n(during breastfeeding or with remaining transplacental \nantibodies), and atypical measles, which largely affects \npersons immunized with the killed vaccine during the 1960s.\nClinical Manifestations\nAfter a 10-day incubation period, the viral prodrome phase \nconsists of fever (may exceed 104\u00b0 F), cough, coryza, con -\njunctivitis, photophobia, and myalgias, and lasts about \n1 week. The classic exanthem consisting of erythema -\ntous confluent macules and papules is usually apparent at \n2 weeks. The cutaneous eruption spreads cephalocaudally \nover 3 days, and resolves with fine de squamation and a \nbrown hyperpigmentation. Koplik spots are pathogno -\nmonic and appear on the buccal, labial, and gingival muco -\nsae just prior to the exanthem. They are 1- to 2-mm bluish \nmacules on an erythematous base. Measles infection is usu -\nally benign and self-limited but has the potential to be fatal \nin malnourished and/or immunocompromised patients.\nThe most common complication of measles is sec -\nondary bacterial infection. Pneumonia occurs more \nfrequently in children and is the most common cause \nof death associated with the virus. Atypical measles is a \ncharacteristic clinical syndrome seen in recipients of the \nkilled vaccine that was used in the United States from \n1963 to 1967. The cutaneous eruption begins on the \nwrists, arms, and soles, and then spreads centrally to the \nextremities and trunk. The lesions are initially morbil -\nliform and then become vesicular, purpuric, or hemor -\nrhagic. Koplik spots are rarely present.\nDiagnosis\nThe clinical presentation is often classic; however, in \ncountries with low measles prevalence, confirmation \nshould be made with viral culture  or serology (anti-\nmeasles IgM). Of note, atypical measles presents with a \nunique antibody titer pattern. Before the onset or at the \nonset of the exanthema, the titer is less than 1:5 but by \nday 10 the titer is greater than 1:1280.CHAPTER 31\nViral Diseases\nRamya Kollipara \u2022 Sheevam Shah  \u2022 Stephen K.

It is believed to be \nmediated by bradykinin as well.\nMastocytosis is frequently associated with urticarial le -\nsions (Chapter 42).\nUrticaria can be a manifestation of exercise-induced \nanaphylaxis (EIAn). There are two subgroups of patients \nwith EIAn. One group experiences anaphylaxis pro -\nvoked by exercise alone. The second group experiences \nanaphylaxis when exercise happens in temporal prox -\nimity to ingestion of food such as gluten. Cholinergic \nurticaria, a type of physical urticaria, can be associated \nwith exercise as well. However, EIAn differs from cho -\nlinergic urticaria in that it can happen in temperature-\ncontrolled environments, whereas cholinergic urticaria \nis associated with sweating/increased core body temper -\nature. Diagnostically, cholinergic urticaria but not EIAn \ncan be triggered by a hot bath.\nDistinctive Urticarial Syndromes\nUrticaria is also a feature of several syndromes ( Table \n10-2).

The serum-free light-chain assay has emerged as the most sensitive method for the detection of plasma cell dyscrasias characterized by overproduction of light chains. When a patient is suspected of having a cryopro -\ntein-related disease, blood can be drawn for both serum and plasma sampling and kept at body temperature until the cellular elements have been removed. Following at least overnight refrigeration, each sample is then exam -\nined for evidence of a cryoprecipitate. A cryoglobulin should appear in both the serum and the plasma sample, whereas cryofibrinogen will appear in only the plasma fraction. Immunofixation of the precipitated cryoglobu -\nlin can then define its composition. Patients found to have type I or II cryoglobulins should be examined for an underlying plasma cell dyscrasia or lymphoprolifera -\ntive disorder. Patients with type II or III cryoglobulins should be evaluated for hepatitis C viral infection; non -\nhepatitis-related disease may be secondary to an underly-ing connective tissue or autoimmune disease, or to other chronic infections or inflammatory diseases.\nVessel occlusion caused by cold agglutinins is rare, de-\nspite their low-level presence in many different acute and chronic diseases. If hyperviscosity syndrome is suspected, serum viscosity measurements are usually easily obtained from clinical laboratories, but whole-blood viscosity \n measurements remain a specialized research procedure.\nTreatment\nThe treatment of cryoglobulinemia depends on the clini -\ncal features. If clinically relevant cold sensitivity is pres -\nent, adequate clothing and avoidance of cold exposure are essential and may be all that is required. For those with more severe disease, treatment of the underlying plasma cell dyscrasia or lymphoproliferative disorder is indicat-ed. In patients with type II or III cryoglobulinemia, in whom necrotizing vasculitis is the usual presenting find -\ning, cutaneous lesions may respond to oral dapsone or colchicine therapy. Aggressive therapy with systemic cor -\nticosteroids in combination with immunosuppressive or cytotoxic agents may be required in severe systemic dis -\nease. In hepatitis-C-related cryoglobulinemia, interferon regimens of antiviral therapy may reduce the vasculitis but can occasionally induce flaring. Published data are rare with regard to the effect of new specific antihepa -\ntitis C agents; vasculitis remission is reported. Patients with specific underlying etiologic disorders may respond to effective treatment of that disorder. Plasmapheresis may provide temporary but rapid relief of symptoms in patients with high levels of circulating cryoglobulins, and it may be synergistic when combined with chemotherapy in appropriate cases. Intravenous \u03b3-globulin therapy is \noccasionally successful in cryoglobulinemia and refrac -\ntory vasculitis.\nCold agglutinin disease is best treated by keeping the \npatient (particularly the extremities) warm. Cytotoxic agents may be useful in some patients, but plasmapheresis is contraindicated because it may induce severe hemolytic anemia. Postinfectious cases of cold agglutinin disease are usually self-limiting.\nFor patients in whom simple measures do not ad -\ndress the clinical manifestations of cryofibrinogenemia, the use of an oral anabolic steroid such as stanozolol \n(4 to 8  mg/day) or danazol may prove beneficial, with  \nrapid pain relief and ulcer healing observed in a num -\nber of patients. Stanozolol and danazol are androgenic steroids with fibrinolytic properties. Stanozolol has been removed from the market in the United States, but apparently can be obtained through compounding pharmacies. Other therapies for livedoid vasculopathy associated with cryofibrinogenemia include heparin, warfarin, streptokinase, plasmapheresis, immunosup-pressive agents, and tissue plasminogen activator.",
        "f78994a9-2d01-4ad9-a8a9-ce73c4618ec6": "377\nHair disorders are commonly associated with systemic \ndisease although they may be overlooked by clinicians \nand dismissed as unimportant, particularly in comparison \nwith the patient\u2019s underlying systemic illness. This is an \nunfortunate reality since hair can be perceived as a criti -\ncal indicator of health, prosperity, and even social status. \nOne retrospective review on the psychologic impact of \nalopecia on patients (regardless of cause) indicated that \nsuch patients are more likely to suffer from psychiatric \nillness, low self-esteem, and poor quality of life. Likewise, \nAmericans have been estimated to spend over $2 billion \nannually on the removal of unwanted hair. In diagnos -\ning and treating diseases that are associated with hair dis -\norders, it is imperative that clinicians are mindful of the \nunique needs and sensitivities inherent to this group of \npatients.\nFOLLICULAR BIOLOGY\nIn order to understand the behavior of the hair follicle in \nthe setting of systemic disease, it is first important to appre -\nciate normal follicular biology. At the time of birth, there \nare approximately 150,000 hair follicles on the scalp. Each \nundergoes a continuous cyclic pattern of changes (the fol -\nlicular lifecycle) during the person\u2019s lifetime. The first two \ncycles of hair growth occur synchronously in utero and then shortly after birth. After that, each follicle seems to \nhave a growth cycle independent of those around it.\nThe duration of hair growth cycles is dependent on \nvarying factors, including location of the hair, the indi -\nvidual\u2019s age, nutritional habits, hormonal factors, and \nhealth status.\nIn healthy individuals, scalp hair grows approximate -\nly 0.35 mm/day (1 cm per month). It should be noted, \nhowever, that data suggest that African textured hair \ngrows more slowly, at approximately 0.77 cm per month. \nGrowth rates are also influenced by the type and ana -\ntomic location of hairs. Vellus hairs are widely distrib -\nuted throughout the body, rooted in the upper dermis. \nThey are nonpigmented, lacking melanin and a medulla, \nand are finely textured, measuring 0.03 mm or less in \ndiameter and less than 1 cm in length. Growth rates for \nvellus hairs range from 0.03 to 0.13 mm/day. Hormonal \ninfluences at puberty induce vellus hairs to be replaced \nby terminal hairs in hormone-sensitive areas such as the \naxillae and pubis. Terminal hairs are medullated and con -\ntain melanin and thus are pigmented. They are anchored \nmore deeply in the dermis.\nEach hair follicle passes through three cycles: anagen \n(growth), catagen (involution), and telogen (rest) ( Fig. 43-1 ). \nA latency or exogen phase is noted in up to 80% of hair \ncycles. In exogen, the hair shaft is shed without regrowth, \nand a new anagen phase is turned on. Hair length is de -\ntermined by the rate and duration of the anagen phase, \nwhich is terminated by an internal biologic \u201cclock\u201d built \ninto every follicle. On average, anagen duration on the \nscalp varies from 2 to 6 years. The catagen phase marks \nthe termination of the growing phase.\nCatagen, a transitional phase of acute follicular re -\ngression, is irreversible and of relatively short duration, \nlasting only 2 to 3 weeks. The completion of catagen is \nmarked by formation of the keratinized and depigmented \nclub hair. Only 1% to 2% of scalp hairs are in catagen at \nany one time.\nTelogen, the resting phase, begins when catagen \nis complete. With an average duration of 3 months, \n approximately 15% of scalp hairs are in telogen at any \ngiven time. Telogen hairs account for the 50 to 100 scalp \nhairs shed normally each day. The percentage of hairs \nin the telogen phase, called the telogen count, varies be -\ntween individuals and even between parts of the scalp. \nThe telogen hair (club hair) is shed during the exogen \nphase, which may or may not coincide with the new ana -\ngen phase. The next anagen phase begins anew from the \nreservoir of follicular stem cells residing in the bulge area, \nnear where the arrector pili muscle inserts into the hair \nfollicle.",

A closely related disease, polymyositis, has all the  \nclinical features of the muscular disease of dermatomyo\u00ad\nsitis but lacks the characteristic cutaneous findings. A \nthird idiopathic inflammatory myopathy, inclusion body \nmyositis, also lacks cutaneous disease, but has a unique \npattern of weakness with prominent involvement of the \nwrist and finger flexors and quadriceps. The pathogen \u00ad\nesis of these disorders is only partially understood, but \nimmune\u00admediated muscle damage is believed to be im \u00ad\nportant as a pathogenetic mechanism. Dermatomyositis \nappears to be characterized by an increased frequency \nof internal malignancy, whereas the association of poly \u00ad\nmyositis with malignancy is less well resolved. There is \na female to male preponderance of approximately 2:1, \nwith a peak incidence in the fifth and sixth decades. A \njuvenile form of dermatomyositis also exists, which is not \nassociated with an increased risk of malignancy, but does \nhave an increased incidence of calcinosis cutis and vas \u00ad\nculitis. Because both dermatomyositis and polymyositis are associated with morbidity and occasional deaths, a \nprompt and aggressive approach to therapy is indicated.\nBohan and Peter first suggested the use of five criteria \nto diagnose dermatomyositis. These include (1) proximal \nsymmetric muscle weakness that progresses over a period \nof weeks to months; (2) elevated serum levels of muscle\u00ad\nderived enzymes; (3) an abnormal electromyogram; (4) \nan abnormal muscle biopsy; and (5) the presence of cu \u00ad\ntaneous disease compatible with dermatomyositis. These \ncriteria are useful for patient evaluation, but it is not nec \u00ad\nessary to perform all of the muscle testing in patients with \ncharacteristic skin disease, particularly those who have \nproximal muscle weakness and elevated muscle\u00adderived \nenzymes.\nThe inflammatory myopathies may be subclassified \ninto eight groups. The following system of classifica \u00ad\ntion has been useful in differentiating groups of pa \u00ad\ntients with regard to their prognosis, potential for an \nassociated process, and potential to respond to various \ntherapies: (1) dermatomyositis; (2) polymyositis; (3) \nmyositis in association with malignancy; (4) juvenile \ndermatomyositis (most often diagnosed before age 16); \n(5) myositis in association with another connective tis \u00ad\nsue disease; (6) inclusion body myositis; (7) dermato \u00ad\nmyositis sine myositis (amyopathic dermatomyositis); \nand (8) drug\u00adinduced disease.\nGiven that the incidence and prevalence of amyopathic \ndermatomyositis appear to be increasing, Sontheimer has \nproposed a revised classification system that better recog \u00ad\nnizes the cutaneous manifestations of the inflammatory \nmyopathies ( Table 2\u00ad1 ).\nPATHOGENESIS\nThe pathogenesis of the idiopathic inflammatory myopa \u00ad\nthies is not well understood. The pathogenetic mechanisms \ninvolved in the muscular disease are better  understood \nthan are those involved in the induction of cutaneous dis \u00ad\nease. Many agents and events have been associated with \nthe appearance of dermatomyositis, including various in \u00ad\nfections (particularly viral or parasitic  infections), vaccina \u00ad\ntion, neoplasms, drug\u00adinduced disease, various types of \nstress, and trauma. In addition, dermatomyositis and poly \u00ad\nmyositis have been linked with various diseases associated \nwith immunologic phenomena. The demonstration of the \nJo\u00ad1 antibody in patients with myositis further supports \na viral etiology because the antigen for the Jo\u00ad1 antibody \nhas characteristics similar to those of viral and muscle pro \u00ad\nteins.

The condition \nimproves with tight glycemic control.\nAcrochordons\nAcrochordons, or skin tags, are common benign skin \ntumors occurring on the eyelids, neck, axilla, and other \nflexural surfaces. In many patients, they appear in con -\njunction with acanthosis nigricans. Some studies have \nshown an increased risk of DM in patients with multiple \nskin tags; however, the evidence regarding a positive cor -\nrelation between the total number of skin tags and the \nincidence of diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance is \ncontroversial.Diabetic Cheiroarthropathy\nDiabetic cheiroarthropathy is a condition of limited joint \nmobility that is seen in up to 40% of patients with diabe -\ntes. The most commonly affected joints are the metacar -\npophalangeal and interphalangeal joints, leading to joint \nstiffness. Limited joint mobility is caused by the thick -\nening of periarticular connective tissue, and the disease \nprocess is positively correlated with long-standing poorly \ncontrolled diabetes. In patients with diabetic cheiroar -\nthropathy, there is a fourfold increase in the risk of mi -\ncrovascular disease.\nDiabetic Thick Skin\nThick skin in various clinical forms can be seen in dia -\nbetics, including waxy thickening of the dorsal hand and \nscleredema. The most common form is a benign condi -\ntion of generalized thickening of the skin, which is usually \nasymptomatic. This condition often goes unrecognized, \nbut measurement through ultrasound will reveal thicker-\nthan-normal skin. The most common areas affected are \nthe hands and feet.\nDiabetes-Related Pruritus\nPruritus is occasionally present in diabetics and is mainly \nassociated with diabetic neuropathy. It more commonly \npresents as localized pruritus in the scalp, trunk, and as \npart of small nerve fiber neuropathy in lower legs.

For most patients, initial hospitalization is required for appropriate monitoring of fluid\u2013electrolyte balance, nu-trition, and thermoregulation, as well as for appropriate skin care.

The immune deficiency predisposes \nthe patient to recurrent sinopulmonary infections and to \nan increased incidence of neoplasia. Patients have a defect \nin cell growth and chromosomal integrity that is associated \nwith increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation. Recent ad -\nvancements in the understanding of diseases with similar \nradiosensitive phenotypes have led to elucidations and bet -\nter understanding of various AT-like disorders. The dis -\ncussion here will be limited to the classical AT phenotype.\nPathogenesis\nAT occurs in 1 in 40,000 to 100,000 live births, with the \nincidence of asymptomatic heterozygotes being as high as  \n1 in 100. The gene responsible for AT is located on chro -\nmosome 11q22.3 and is designated ATM (for ataxia telan -\ngiectasia mutation). This gene encompasses 150 kb of DNA \nand encodes a phosphoprotein. This protein has significant \nhomology to a subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, \nwhich is involved in cell cycle regulation, maintenance of \ngenomic stability, and response to DNA damage.\nFibroblasts and lymphoblasts are extremely sensitive \nto X-rays and chemotherapeutic killing. These cells have \ndefective DNA repair following radiation and fail to slow \ntheir rate of DNA synthesis. These defects are due to the \ninability to arrest the cell cycle at the G1 and G2 phases \nin response to DNA damage, instead progressing to the \nS phase and mitosis, respectively. It is believed that the \nATM protein activates the p53 protein, triggering the \np53 signaling pathway involved in checkpoint regulation in the DNA cell cycle. In addition, there is evidence that \nATM is involved in the activation of proteins involved in \nDNA strand repair and recombination regulation.\nClinical Manifestations\nAtaxia is the earliest clinical manifestation, which typically \nappears when affected children begin to walk. Eye move -\nments are often normal in preschoolers, but children later \ndevelop oculomotor difficulties. Choreoathetosis, dysar -\nthric speech, and myotonic jerks become prominent dur -\ning childhood. Patients are often confined to a wheelchair \nby adolescence. Telangiectases develop between 2 and \n8 years of age and occur first as wire-like vessels on the \nbulbar conjunctiva and later on the exposed areas of the \nauricle, the neck, and the flexor folds of the extremities. \nOther skin abnormalities may include premature graying \nof hair, loss of subcutaneous fat, vitiligo, caf\u00e9-au-lait spots, \nand noninfectious granulomas. Endocrine abnormalities \nfrequently develop with time and include hyperinsulinism \nwith insulin resistance, hypogonadism with delayed sexual \ndevelopment, and growth retardation.

Perilesional skin will show linear deposition of IgA (usually IgA\n1 subclass, but oc -\ncasionally IgA 2) along the basement membrane. Indirect \nimmunofluorescence is positive in about 60% to 70% of cases. BMZ split skin is a somewhat more sensitive substrate for indirect immunofluorescence.

Dosage and management are similar to those used in DH, and the reader is referred to the discussion of this drug in that section of the chapter.

These \ninclude emollients and moisturizers, especially when the skin is dry, such as in old age, atopic eczema, and ESRD itch. Although they are capable of relieving pruritus due to inflammatory skin disease, corticosteroids are not in -\ntrinsically antipruritic. Topical immunomodulators such as tacrolimus or pimecrolimus have a role in itch associ -\nated with eczema.\nCoolants and counterirritants such as menthol acti-\nvate nerve fibers for cold and inhibit C nerve fibers that transmit warmth and itch. Other topical agents include local anesthetics such as pramoxine and topical capsaicin, which have a role in the treatment of localized itch, in particular that associated with neuropathic itch.\nSystemic corticosteroids are not indicated, except \nwhen the diagnosis of a specific steroid-responsive dis -\nease (such as bullous pemphigoid) has been established.\nSystemic antipruritic treatments include drugs that \nare used for neuropathic pain, such as gabapentin, pre -\ngabalin, and mirtazapine and paroxetine. As mentioned, opioids have a role in systemic generalized itch. There -\nfore, opiate antagonists such as naltrexone have been used for the treatment of pruritus, in particular itch associated with cholestasis, but owing to their significant side effects they are not commonly used. There are currently new \u03ba \nagonists in development that seem a promising avenue for treating severe pruritus. Butorphanol is a \u03ba agonist \nand \u03bc antagonist that is a commercially available analgesic \nand has fewer side effects than the \u03bc antagonists. It has \nbeen reported to be effective for different types of severe generalized pruritus.\nAntihistamines are only antipruritic if the pruritus \nis caused by histamine, as in urticarial or drug erup -\ntions. They only benefit nonhistamine-mediated itch through their sedating/tranquilizing properties. First-generation H\n1 antihistamines such as hydroxyzine \nhave marked sedative and anticholinergic actions and are useful in severe chronic urticaria, enabling patients with chronic itch to sleep. Second-generation antihis -\ntamines such as loratadine, desloratadine, cetirizine, and levocetirizine are suitable in the daytime for re -\nlief of pruritus due to urticaria. The role of these non -\nsedating antihistamines in other pruritic disorders is limited. Thalidomide was found to have a role in treat -\ning chronic itch in particular prurigo nodularis, but because of the high cost and monitoring requirements is rarely used.\nPhototherapy has been used for more than a decade to \ntreat different types of itch. UVB therapy, both broad -\nband and narrowband, seems to be the most effective. The treatment is safe and can be repeated as necessary. It is beneficial for itch associated with atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and chronic renal failure. Remissions may last \nfor as long as 18  months.\nSeveral studies have shown that behavioral modifica -\ntion therapy reduces the intensity and perception of itch. Other possible behavioral interventions include stress re -\nduction and biofeedback.

Two or more types of urticaria can \nsometimes coexist in the same patient. Table 10-2  pres -\nents the EAACI/GA2LEN/EDF/WAO, an international \nmultispecialty panel consensus on classification of chron -\nic urticaria updated in 2013.\nPhysical urticarias are an important subgroup of the \nchronic urticarias, where wheals and/or angioedema are \ninduced by environmental stimuli such as heat, cold, pres -\nsure, exercise, water, vibration, and sunlight ( Table 10-3 ). \nSymptomatic dermatographism ( Fig. 10-2 ) is the most \ncommon of all physical urticarias. It manifests as a prompt \nwheal-and-flare response to stroking pressure applied to the \nskin. Cold contact urticaria refers to pruritus and swelling \nwith exposure of the skin to contact with a cold stimulus. \nThe diagnosis can be confirmed by applying an ice cube to \nthe forearm skin and observing the wheal-and-flare reaction during rewarming of the skin. Systemic symptoms, such \nas flushing, headache, syncope, and abdominal pain, can \ndevelop if the patient is widely exposed to cold, e.g., cold \nbaths and swimming. A less common and potentially life-\nthreatening form of cold urticaria occurs with cold air ex -\nposure. Delayed pressure urticaria is swelling with onset 3 \nto 12 hours after a pressure stimulus is applied to the skin. \nSolar urticaria happens when the skin is exposed to various \nwavelengths of ultraviolet and visible light. Its diagnosis \ncan be confirmed with phototesting. Heat urticaria is one \nof the rarest forms of urticaria. Within minutes of contact \nwith heat, itching and whealing occur at the site of contact. \nVibratory angioedema refers to pruritus and localized swell -\ning within minutes of skin exposure to a vibratory stimulus, \nwith lesions lasting for approximately 1 hour. Cholinergic \nurticaria occurs 15 minutes after an increase in the core \nbody temperature. Triggers include physical exertion, sud -\nden emotional stress, drinking alcohol, eating spicy food, \netc. It presents as multiple pinpointed (1 to 3 mm) papules \nsurrounded by large flares with a predilection for the upper \nbody. Aquagenic urticaria is rare. It is characterized by 1 to \n3 mm papules, which occur after direct contact of the skin \nwith any source of water independent of the temperature. \nInterestingly, patients have no problem consuming water. \nIgE-mediated immediate hypersensitivity mechanisms are \ninvolved in several physical urticarias, supported by passive \nand reverse passive transfer experiments.\nPhysical urticarias may last for many years. In most \npatients, it is caused by a specific physical stimulus; in rare \ncases, multiple physical stimuli can trigger urticaria in the \nsame patient. Sometimes patients with physical urticaria \nmay also have concomitant chronic idiopathic urticaria, \nin which case they are less likely to respond to conven -\ntional pharmacotherapy.",

Patients with TSC2 \nmutations have more severe disease than patients with \nTSC1 mutations.\nEvidence supports the belief that tuberin and hamartin \nform an intracellular heterodimer that functions as a tu -\nmor suppressor and senses various intra- and extracellular \nsignals including growth factor stimulation, hypoxia, and \nenergy levels. This complex also targets a Ras homolog \nenriched in the brain (Rheb), which in turn inhibits mam -\nmalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine/threonine \nkinase involved in cell growth and proliferation. This tu -\nberin/hamartin complex contains a region with homol -\nogy to the catalytic domain of rap1 GTPase-activation \nprotein. This heterodimer protein induces the inactive \nstate by stimulating GTPase-activation protein (GAP) \nand functions by downregulating Rheb. Rheb in its active \nstates induces mTOR, which in turn phosphorylates 4E \nbinding protein (4e-BP1), ribosomal protein S6 kinase \nb (S6K1), and eukaryotic translation factor 2; all are in -\nvolved in ribosomal biosynthesis recruitment and transla -\ntion initiation. It is a mutation within the GAP domain of \nthe protein that results in most cases of TSC. Better un -\nderstanding of the role of the hamartin/tuberin complex",

Other tests for venous insufficiency \ninclude duplex ultrasonographic scanning, photoplethys -\nmography, air plethysmography, strain gauge plethys -\nmography, light reflux rheography, foot volumetry, and \nphlebography. Duplex ultrasonographic scanning allows \ndirect visualization of the veins, identifies venous flow, and maps superficial and deep veins. It perhaps can be consid -\nered the diagnostic standard, but this method also requires \nthe most technical proficiency.\nArterial Studies\nThe measurement of systolic blood pressure in the ankle \nis the most sensitive method of detecting large-vessel \ndisease. The ABI is determined by dividing the systolic \npressure in the ankle by that in the arm. Patients with \nmoderate to severe arterial disease will have an ABI <0.7. \nIn patients whose peripheral pulses are not palpable, a \nDoppler flowmeter should be used to hear the arterial \npulsations over the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial ar -\nteries. Any patient whose Doppler studies suggest arterial \ndisease should have arteriography and surgical assess -\nment for the feasibility of arterial reconstruction. In pa -\ntients with diabetes mellitus, noninvasive vascular studies \n(including the ABI) are frequently poor indicators of the \nseverity of arteriosclerotic disease. Consequently, if isch -\nemia is suspected in such patients, additional tests should \nbe performed such as the toe\u2013brachial index.\nPatients with leg ulcerations attributable to rheumatoid \narthritis or systemic sclerosis may have arterial or venous \ninsufficiency that contributes to ulcer formation and failure \nto heal. Calf muscle failure may predispose these patients \nto venous ulcerations. A study of 15 consecutive patients \nwith leg ulcerations together with one of these conditions \nshowed that all but one had vascular insufficiency that mark -\nedly contributed to their ulcer formation, despite the clinical \ndiagnosis of connective tissue disease-associated ulceration. \nTherefore, patients with rheumatic diseases and ulcerations \nthat respond poorly to appropriate therapies might need \nvascular assessment to look for complicating disease.\nAdditional noninvasive tests (pulse waves from the \ntoes and transcutaneous oximetry) may be helpful when \nassessing the risk of amputation in patients with skin  \nlesions and arterial disease. Pulse waves from the toes can \nbe recorded quickly and easily with photoplethysmogra -\nphy, and the wave amplitude is indicative of blood flow. \nThese measurements may help guide decisions about  \narterial reconstruction.\nTranscutaneous oximetry (the amount of oxygen diffus -\ning through the skin from the capillaries) can be  measured \nwith an electrode applied to the skin surface. Oximetry can \nbe used to predict wound healing and the most appropri -\nate level for amputation. In one study, successful healing of \nbelow-knee amputations occurred in 96% of patients with \na calf transcutaneous oxygen pressure >20 mm Hg, but \nsuccessful healing occurred in only 50% of patients with a \ncalf transcutaneous oxygen pressure of \u226420 mm Hg.\nBiopsy\n\t\u2022\t\tBiopsy\tof\tthe\tulcer\tneeds\tto\tbe\tconsidered\twhen\tatypical\t\netiology is suspected, or when treatment response is not \nadequate.\n\t\u2022\t\tAn\tincisional\tbiopsy\tinvolving\tthe\twound\tedge\tis\tpreferred.\n\t\u2022\t\tTissue\tis\tto\tbe\tsent\tto\thistology\tand\ttissue\tculture.",

A detailed medical, dietary, and drug history is \nessential in establishing a diagnosis of telogen effluvium.\nPhysical examination of any patient with hair loss \nshould begin with an overall inspection of the patient\u2019s \nhair density. The scalp of a patient with telogen efflu -\nvium should appear within normal limits, without ery -\nthema or scale (unless there is a secondary diagnosis). A \nhair pull test, in which 25 to 50 hairs are pulled with firm \nand consistent traction from root to tip, should be done \nin four quadrants. Patients with telogen effluvium will \nhave a positive result, i.e., more than three hair shafts, \nthe roots of which show the depigmented, keratinized, \nclubbed morphology of telogen hairs ( Fig. 43-3 ). The \npatient should not have shampooed for at least one day \nprior to the hair pull test. A forcible hair pluck extracts \na mixture of normal anagen and telogen hairs and an oc -\ncasional catagen hair. The percentage of telogen hairs is \nincreased, a criterion without which the diagnosis of telo -\ngen effluvium cannot be established with certainty ( Fig. \n43-4 ). On biopsy, a 4-mm scalp punch specimen should \ncontain 25 to 50 terminal follicles. When more than 12% \nto 15% of hairs are in telogen, a diagnosis of telogen ef -\nfluvium is likely.The cornerstone of telogen effluvium management is \nreassurance. Once an underlying cause is identified, pa -\ntients can be advised that this is a self-limiting process \nthat runs a predictable course and then corrects itself. \nReassurance can also be facilitated by educating patients \nabout the pathophysiology behind the process including \nthe fact that each shed hair is being replaced by a newly \ngrowing hair.\nAnagen Arrest\nAnagen arrest occurs when there is a sudden halt in the \nmitotic activity of the hair matrix cells. Hair shafts be -\ncome severely dystrophic, tapering to a point, like the tip \nof a sharpened pencil. At this point, even minimal trauma \ncauses breakage of the distal hair shaft. Although anagen \narrest is sometimes referred to as anagen effluvium, this \nis a misnomer because only tapered shafts and not entire \nanagen hairs are shed. Since this process is not depen -\ndent on the hair cycle, breakage occurs quickly after the \ninciting event, usually within 1 to 2 weeks. Because ap -\nproximately 85% of hairs are in anagen phase at any time, \nanagen arrest results in very extensive hair loss.\nAll therapeutic measures intended to inhibit the pro -\nliferation of actively dividing cells can cause the dramatic \nhair loss seen in anagen arrest. The classic example of \nnoninflammatory anagen arrest occurs in the setting of a \nchemotherapeutic drug given systemically to treat a malig -\nnancy. The various agents may act in different ways (e.g., \nas antimetabolites or alkylating agents), but they all inhibit \nmetabolism of rapidly dividing anagen matrix cells. Ana -\ngen arrest is more common and severe with combination \nchemotherapy than with the use of a single drug, and the \nseverity is usually dose-dependent. The most severe hair \nloss occurs with doxorubicin, the nitrosoureas, and cyclo -\nphosphamide. Anticancer doses of radiation therapy have \na similar effect on hair follicles ( Fig. 43-5 ). Other agents \ncausing anagen arrest are listed in Table 43-4 . Of note, \nboth thallium and X-irradiation have been used with the \nintention of causing total hair depilation for therapeutic \npurposes. Anagen arrest may also be caused by endocrine \ndiseases, trauma or pressure, and pemphigus vulgaris.\nFIGURE 43-2  n Young woman with diffusely thin hair from telo -\ngen effluvium .\nFIGURE 43-3  n Spontaneously shed telogen hair.

Additional sites of in -\nvolvement include mucosal surfaces such as the conjunc -\ntivae ( Fig. 39-22 ).\nHistologic features of acute cutaneous GVHD include \nnecrotic keratinocytes and lymphocytes within the epi -\ndermis as well as in the upper papillary dermis. When the \nlymphocytes are adjacent to necrotic keratinocytes, this \nis termed satellite cell necrosis. Unfortunately, the histo -\nlogic findings in early GVHD may be rather nonspecific, \nand the differential diagnosis includes drug eruptions \nand viral exanthems, the same as the clinical differential \ndiagnosis of the morbilliform eruption. One study sug -\ngested that the decision to treat suspected acute GVHD \ndepended not on skin biopsy findings, but rather on the \nclinical severity of the presumed acute GVHD (at the \ntime of the biopsy). However, this study did not address \nthe subsequent taper of immunosuppressants, which \ncould be influenced by the biopsy findings.\nClassically, prophylactic treatment for acute GVHD \nconsists of cyclosporine (CsA) or tacrolimus in conjunc -\ntion with methotrexate. However, methotrexate is in -\ncreasingly being replaced by mycophenolate mofetil or \nsirolimus (rapamycin), because these two drugs result in \na reduced incidence of mucositis. The CsA or tacrolimus \nis continued for approximately 180 days post transplant \nand then tapered. Treatment of acute GVHD, which de -\nvelops during prophylactic therapy, consists initially of \nsystemic corticosteroids. In patients who do not respond \nto the addition of corticosteroids, there is no standard \ntreatment protocol, but options include extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), infliximab, daclizumab, basilix -\nimab, and mycophenolate mofetil, with most unrespon -\nsive patients developing chronic GVHD.\nChronic GVHD\nChronic GVHD is more common in allogeneic hemato -\npoietic stem cell transplant patients who have had acute \nGVHD. It may occur as a progression of acute GVHD, \nas a recurrence following a disease-free interval, or in \nthe absence of a history of acute GVHD (i.e., de novo). \nChronic GVHD occurs in approximately 50% to 80% \nof patients who have received such transplants. In addi -\ntion to the skin, gut and liver, chronic GVHD can affect \nthe eyes and salivary glands (a Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s-like syndrome), \nthe lung (bronchiolitis obliterans), and the esophagus (a \nscleroderma-like process). Chronic cutaneous GVHD is \nclassically divided into two major forms, lichenoid and \nsclerodermoid.\nLichenoid GVHD shares clinical and histologic features \nwith lichen planus and is characterized by flat-topped, pink \nto violet scaly papules ( Fig. 39-23 A) and white lacy plaques \non the oral mucosa.

The systemic mycoses comprise \ntwo subgroups: four diseases (histoplasmosis, coccidioi -\ndomycosis, blastomycosis, paracoccidioidomycosis) that \nusually cause subclinical or transient, self-limited pulmo -\nnary infections in immunocompetent individuals. Never -\ntheless, they may disseminate to involve the skin in both \nimmunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts. In \nimmunocompetent hosts, cutaneous involvement often \npresents with chronic crusted or granulomatous papules \nor plaques.\nThe systemic mycoses also include a subgroup of \nopportunistic diseases (e.g., cryptococcosis, mucormy -\ncosis, aspergillosis) that occur almost exclusively in im -\nmunocompromised hosts.

Because of the \nnature of the host\u2019s immunologic status, these infec -\ntions often present as acute, rapidly evolving, necrotiz -\ning infections.\nThe most prevalent cutaneous mycoses, dermato -\nphyte infections, are caused by keratinophilic fungi that \ninfect epidermis, hair, and nails  but rarely cause sys -\ntemic disease  (extremely rare instances in severely com -\npromised hosts). These will not be discussed further. \nNotably, active untreated dermatophyte infections can \ndamage the epidermal barrier and serve as a portal of \nentry for other infectious agents, particularly bacteria \nand yeasts, and complete dermatologic examination is \nimportant when searching for potential sources of infec -\ntion in all hosts.\nSUBCUTANEOUS MYCOSES WITH \nSYSTEMIC MANIFESTATIONS\nThe subcutaneous mycoses are caused by taxonomi -\ncally diverse fungi that ordinarily subsist on decaying \norganic matter and have few intrinsic virulence factors. \nTypically people acquire these conditions through mi -\nnor, often unnoticed, percutaneous trauma with dead \nor decaying plant materials. Mammalian immune re -\nsponses to these organisms are rarely vigorous and \nrarely effective; therefore these mycoses usually de -\nvelop into chronic, unremitting infections that are con -\nfined to skin and subcutaneous tissues. Subcutaneous \nmycoses are most common among people in tropical \nand warm temperate areas who are routinely exposed \nto decaying organic matter.

The episodes last 1 to 3 weeks and recur  \nevery 1 to 2 months. They may occur spontaneously or \nmay be triggered after local injury or minor infections. \nMyalgia and fever are characteristic features of attacks. \nFrequently, the sole cutaneous manifestation may be \nerythema overlying the affected muscles ( Fig. 8-4 ). The \nerythema may migrate to distal extremities. Other mor -\nphologies such as dermal papules, plaques, and reticu -\nlated erythema have less commonly been described. The \n majority of patients will also have abdominal symptoms \nsuch as cramping and nausea. Other described signs \nand symptoms include periorbital edema, conjunctivitis, \n uveitis, pleuritic, and testicular pain.\nEvaluation\nAcute phase reactants are elevated in an attack, specifi -\ncally ESR, CRP, fibrinogen, haptoglobin, and ferritin.  \nA complete blood count may reveal a neutrophil leukocy -\ntosis, thrombocytosis, and anemia. Soluble TNF receptor \ncan be measured showing low serum levels (<1 mg/mL). \nSAA levels are invariably raised so monitoring for amyloi -\ndosis is important (urinalysis for proteinuria), which has \nbeen reported in about 14% of TRAPS patients.

TNF blockade with etaner -\ncept may reduce symptoms and inflammatory markers in \nsome patients. However, there are reports of a paradoxi -\ncal worsening of inflammation with other TNF- \u03b1 inhibi -\ntors such as adalimumab and infliximab. There are reports \nthat IL-1 inhibition with both anakinra and canakinumab \nmay resolve clinical manifestations and prevent relapses.\nFAMILIAL MEDITERRANEAN FEVER\nFamilial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the most common \nmonogenic autoinflammatory syndrome. As its name sug -\ngests it predominantly affects people of eastern Mediterra -\nnean origin, especially Sephardic Jewish, Armenian, Turk -\nish, and Arab individuals. Prevalence of FMF in this region \nis in the order of 1:400 to 1:1000 although there have been \ncases reported in Western Europe and the United States.\nPathogenesis\nFMF is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by muta -\ntions in the marenostrin-encoding fever ( MEFV ) gene. \nMEFV  encodes pyrin, which is part of the inflammasome \ncomplex and is an inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome. \nThere are five highly conserved missense mutations iden -\ntified that account for the majority of affected individu -\nals, suggesting a founder effect. It appears that disease \nexpression is related to the amount of mutated pyrin \nproduced, with greater expression leading to increased \nIL-1\u03b2 production. This explains why some patients who \nare heterozygous can have clinical manifestations. There \nis some degree of genotype predicting phenotype with a \npoor prognosis associated with M694V mutation.\nClinical Features\nMost patients will present with their first attack before \nthe age of 20 years. Fever is typically accompanied with \nclinical serositis such as peritonitis, pleuritis, and/or sy -\nnovitis. The sterile peritonitis may be confused with an \nacute abdomen, as patients will present with pain, dis -\ntention, and loss of bowel sounds, which may result in \nunnecessary surgery. Generally, the attacks of FMF will \nresolve after 48 to 96 hours. The characteristic rash of \nFMF is called erysipelas-like erythema (ELE) although \nit affects only 5% to 30% of patients ( Fig. 8-5 ). Typical \ninvolvement is unilateral well-demarcated erythematous \npatches on the lower extremity.",

Recently described cases have attributed \nAGEP to exposure to radiocontrast dye or dialysates, in -\ncluding peritoneal dialysates. In rare cases AGEP has also \nbeen described to occur in the course of viral infections \n(e.g., parvovirus, Coxsackievirus, cytomegalovirus) and \nbacterial infections ( Chlamydia pneumoniae , Mycoplasma  \npneumoniae ). It is thought that drug-specific, HLA- \nexpressing CD+ and CD8+ T cells play a central role in \nthe pathogenesis of AGEP.\nAGEP usually has a rapid onset during the first week \nof drug exposure (often the first 1 to 2 days). The skin \nrash consists of an erythematous edema exhibiting an \nintertriginous predilection, which is followed by the ap -\npearance of hundreds to thousands of nonfollicular, often \ncoalescing, sterile pustules ( Fig. 47-5 ).

The majority of pheochromocytomas develop in \nthe medulla of one or both adrenal glands. Other sites of \norigin include para-aortic sympathetic ganglia, the walls \nof the urinary bladder, the chest, and, extremely rarely, \nsympathetic tissue associated with intracranial branches \nof the vagus nerve. Some inherited disorders predispose \nto pheochromocytomas, including neurofibromatosis, \nvon Hippel\u2013Lindau syndrome, and multiple endocrine \nneoplasia type 2 (or Sipple syndrome). More than 90% of \nthe tumors are benign. They occur most frequently dur -\ning the fourth and fifth decades of life.\nThe most distinctive clinical feature of pheochromocyto -\nma is hypertension, although it accounts for less than 0.1% \nof patients with diastolic hypertension. The hypertension is \nusually paroxysmal and occurs in association with headaches, \npalpitations, sweating, and a feeling of apprehension. Symp -\ntoms can be reproduced experimentally by the injection of \nnorepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrena -\nline). These episodes may occur at weekly intervals or as \nfrequently as 20 times a day. They may be precipitated by \nemotional situations, eating, exercise, and by activities that \ncompress the tumor, such as bending. The only significant \ncutaneous manifestation of pheochromocytoma is flushing, \nwhich appears to occur primarily when the tumor secretes \nlarger amounts of epinephrine than norepinephrine. The \nflushing occurs paroxysmally and is most prominent on \nthe face, chest, and upper extremities. When pheochro -\nmocytomas occur as part of a genetic syndrome, cutaneous \nmanifestations of that syndrome may also be apparent. In \nsome patients with hypertension, for example, recognition \nof caf\u00e9-au-lait macules of neurofibromatosis may lead to the \nappropriate diagnosis.\nThe diagnosis of pheochromocytoma can be estab -\nlished by assaying levels of catecholamines and their  \nmetabolites in the plasma or urine (fractionated catechol -\namines and metanephrines), especially during paroxysmal \nattacks. In patients in whom the episodes are very brief, \nestablishing the diagnosis is much more challenging, \nand, occasionally, induction of attacks with intravenous \nglucagon or histamine is performed. Treatment involves \nthe use of adrenergic antagonists, beginning with alpha blockers such as phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine, \nand surgical removal of the tumors.\nANDROGEN-RELATED DISORDERS\nExcess Androgen Activity\nExcess androgen activity is reflected in precocious pu -\nberty in children and degrees of virilization in women; \nmen are asymptomatic. In women, the cutaneous signs \nof virilization include hirsutism, acne, and androgenic \nalopecia; these may have devastating psychosocial conse -\nquences. Some increase in androgen levels in women at \nadolescence is normal, however, and is responsible for the \ndevelopment of axillary and pubic hair.\nHirsutism is defined relative to cultural and environmen -\ntal norms as more facial and body hair than is considered \nacceptable. It is a common complaint, with a  prevalence \nestimated to be as high as one-third of menstruating and \n75% of postmenopausal women. Objective measurement \nof hirsutism is possible using the Ferriman\u2013Gallwey scale \n(Fig. 27-3 ), which quantifies the extent of hair growth in \nandrogen-dependent areas. Using this scale, mild hirsutism \nis defined by a score of 8 to 15; >15 is considered moderate \nor severe. Hirsutism occurring in the absence of increased \nandrogens is termed idiopathic hirsutism. Hirsutism must \nbe distinguished from hypertrichosis, which is generalized \nexcess hair growth not limited to androgen-sensitive sites. \nHirsutism may or may not be associated with other signs of \nvirilization, including worsening acne, male-pattern alope -\ncia, and menstrual irregularity.",

The prevalence is \nbelieved to be 0.5%, with studies ranging from 0.02% \nto 1.4%. It is estimated that up to 42% of patients with \npsoriasis have concomitant psoriatic arthritis. The great \nmajority of patients develop arthritis about 10 years af -\nter the onset of their skin disease, but about 15% of pa -\ntients develop arthritis before the appearance of psoriasis. \nThere is no direct correlation between the severity of \njoint and skin manifestations. Males and females are af -\nfected equally. The peak age of onset is between 35 and \n45 years.\nPathogenesis\nPsoriatic arthritis can involve the synovium of the pe -\nripheral, the spine and sacroiliac joints, as well as the \nentheses, which are the attachment sites of ligaments, \ntendons, and joint capsules to bone. The pathogenesis of \npsoriatic arthritis is poorly understood. However, one of \nthe features characterizing psoriatic arthritis is extensive \nbone resorption, unlike what is seen in most other ar -\nthritic conditions. Patients with psoriatic arthritis have \nincreased numbers of circulating osteoclast precursors, \nand osteoclasts arise spontaneously in cultures of periph -\neral blood mononuclear cells from patients with psoriatic \narthritis suggesting that osteoclasts have a major role in \nits pathogenesis. What drives the activation of the osteo -\nclasts and the cytokine involved is not clear, but there is \nabundant overexpression of proinflammatory cytokine in \nthe inflamed synovium including TNF- \u03b1, IL-1 \u03b2, and IL-\n6. Recent data from clinical trials have implicated IL-17A \nas having an important role in the pathogenesis of psori -\natic arthritis.\nClinical Manifestations\nPsoriatic arthritis has several distinctive clinical features \nthat distinguish it from more common arthritides such as \nrheumatoid arthritis. Apart from the frequent cutaneous \ninvolvement with psoriasis, these features include involve -\nment of the distal interphalangeal joints (DIP); an asym -\nmetric distribution of involved joints; and the presence of \ndactylitis, enthesitis, and sacroiliitis. Radiologic changes \noften present as osteolysis with widespread  erosive bone \nlesions, and as periarticular new bone formation. Patients \nwith psoriatic arthritis typically test negative for rheuma -\ntoid factor and anticitrullinated peptide antibodies. These \nfeatures are incorporated into the CASPAR (ClASsifica -\ntion of Psoriatic Arthritis) diagnostic criteria for psoriatic \narthritis ( Table 6-3 ). If the patient has three of out six \npossible points, the CASPAR criteria have a specificity \nof 98.7% and sensitivity of 91.4% for psoriatic arthritis. \nHowever, of note is that despite these distinctive clinical",

It works well in combination with a bi -\nologic and reduces the risk of antidrug antibodies, which \ncan over time decrease the effectiveness of the biologic. \nThere is some evidence that methotrexate may lower car -\ndiovascular disease in psoriasis.\nCyclosporine is indicated for the treatment of adult, \nnonimmunocompromised patients with severe (i.e., ex -\ntensive and/or disabling), recalcitrant, plaque psoriasis \nwho have failed to respond to at least one systemic ther -\napy, or in patients for whom other systemic therapies are \ncontraindicated, or cannot be tolerated. Of the systemic \nagents, it is the authors\u2019 opinion that cyclosporine has \nthe quickest onset of action, which makes it a preferred \ntherapy for patients with a severe psoriasis flare, eryth -\nrodermic psoriasis, or pustular psoriasis. Cyclosporine \nmay increase blood pressure and lipids, which is a con -\nsideration for this patient population already at risk for \ncardiovascular disease.\nWhen taking acitretin, patients may experience intoler -\nable side effects such as chapped skin, hair loss, and peeling \nskin on the palms and soles. Acitretin may increase triglyc -\nerides and less commonly blood glucose.

The first episode \nof venous ulceration may occur much earlier than this, \nhowever: 13% are affected by age 30 years, 22% by age \n40 years. Studies suggest a somewhat increased risk in \nwomen, with a female: male ratio of 1.6: 1.\nMost venous ulcerations occur in the area between the \nankle and the lower calf (the gaiter area), classically over \nthe medial malleolus, and characteristically have an irreg -\nular, shaggy border ( Fig. 46-10 ). VLUs are typically su -\nperficial, and thus rarely extend to bone or tendon. While \npatients are at high risk for skin and soft tissue infection \nsuch as cellulitis, bone infection is rare, the prevalence of \nosteomyelitis is low, and, in the absence of concomitant \narterial insufficiency, so is their risk of amputation.\nPatients with venous ulcerations typically describe \naching and swelling in the legs that are exacerbated \nby dependency and relieved by elevation of the limb. \n Ulcerations themselves are classically painless but when as -\nsociated with pain, it is usually described as a burning sensa -\ntion or ache. Edema of the lower limbs is common. Brown \nor brown-red hemosiderin pigmentation occurs because \nof extravasation of red cells into the dermis, collection of \n hemosiderin within macrophages, and melanin deposition \nand increased production. Eczematous changes with erythe -\nma, scaling, pruritus, and sometimes weeping are common.\nLipodermatosclerosis or sclerosing panniculitis (woody \ninduration and fibrosis of the dermis and subcutaneous tis -\nsue) often develops in patients with venous insufficiency, \nand often precedes venous ulceration. After ulceration is \nwell established, repeat episodes of infection and celluli -\ntis can damage the lymphatic system and result in chronic \nlymphedema.

The \nmost common site of bleeding is the stomach. This may \ndevelop from gastritis or peptic ulcer disease. Diffuse \nsuperficial erosions rather than focal bleeding are often \nfound in the gastrointestinal tract.

Gastric bleeding may occur early before ocular \nand cutaneous changes are fully developed.\nEvaluation\nThe diagnosis is confirmed by the clinical picture and \nthe demonstration of fragmented, calcified elastic fibers \non skin biopsy that is essential for diagnosis. Skin biopsy \nof flexural skin or scars is warranted in both suspected \ncases and potentially involved family members. Exami -\nnation by light microscopy demonstrates fragmentation \nand irregular clumping of elastic tissue in the middle to \ndeep dermis. Staining for calcium frequently shows sig -\nnificant elastic tissue calcification. Although such find -\nings are classically present in involved skin, clinically \nnormal-appearing skin of the flexural areas may show \nsimilar findings. Biopsy may confirm a diagnosis of PXE \nin patients with angioid streaks and minimal cutaneous \nfindings.\nThe diagnosis is suggested by angioid streaks in the \nsecond decade of life, or by a positive family history. An -\ngioid streaks are not sufficient for the diagnosis. They are \nhighly suggestive of the disease in patients with a posi -\ntive family history. In 85% of patients with skin findings, \nangioid streaks are present in the eye grounds. If PXE is \nsuspected, detailed examination by an ophthalmologist is \nessential.

Testing detects a mutation in \none allele in almost all affected individuals and in both al -\nleles in close to 90%. Sequence analysis detects missense \nmutations, nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations,  \nas well as small deletions and insertions. Genetic testing \nand interpretation of results should be accompanied by \ngenetic counseling.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThe characteristic yellowish papules of PXE may be \nconfused with solar elastosis. The neck is a common site \nfor both, but PXE also occurs in the axilla, groin, and \npopliteal and antecubital fossae. Solar elastosis produces \nabnormal elastic tissue that is described histologically as \ndense masses in the upper dermis. The abnormal elastic \ntissue of solar elastosis does not stain for calcium.

Besides solar elastosis, skin lesions \nsimilar to PXE are found in conditions such as Buschke\u2013\nOllendorf syndrome, late-onset focal dermal elastosis, \nand cutis laxa.\nAngioid streaks are valuable markers for the diagno -\nsis of PXE, but are not pathognomonic findings.

However, there \nmay be considerable variation in phenotypic expression. \nBoth sexes are equally affected. The prevalence of FAP \nhas been estimated to be from 2 to 3: 100,000.\nFAP and Gardner\u2019s syndrome are caused by a highly \nheterogeneous spectrum of point mutations and repre -\nsent a germline mutation in the adenomatous polypo -\nsis coli ( APC ) gene, located on chromosome 5q21. The \nAPC  gene encodes a multidomain protein that plays a \nrole in tumor suppression by antagonizing the WNT \nsignaling pathway. At least 70% of patients with familial \npolyposis coli and Gardner\u2019s syndrome have mutations \nin this gene. The APC  gene acts as a tumor suppressor \ngene, and more than 800 mutations in the gene have \nbeen identified in families with FAP. There is grow -\ning evidence that different APC  gene mutations cor -\nrelate with specific phenotypes. Gardner\u2019s syndrome is \na pathogenic variant of the APC-associated polyposis \nsyndrome.\nPresentation\nThe APC adenomatous polyposis syndromes are well \ncharacterized: familial polyposis coli, Gardner\u2019s syn -\ndrome, and Turcot\u2019s syndrome. Familial polyposis coli \nwas originally separated from Gardner\u2019s syndrome sole -\nly on the basis of the absence of cutaneous findings in \nfamilial polyposis coli. Adenomatous polyps from both \nsyndromes appear histologically, pathologically, and \ndevelopmentally similar. There is great variation in the age of onset and in the number and location of polyps \nin both disorders. Colorectal adenomatous polyps begin \nto appear at 16 years of age. By 35 years of age, 95% of \nindividuals with FAP have polyps. It may be impossible \nto diagnose intestinal polyposis before the age of 16, but \nthe extracolonic manifestations of Gardner\u2019s syndrome \ncan be recognized in infancy or early childhood.\nThe original description of Gardner\u2019s syndrome in -\ncluded significant extraintestinal manifestations: os -\nteomas, epidermal inclusion (epidermoid) cysts, and \nsubcutaneous fibromas in combination with intestinal \npolyposis. In general, osteomas precede the develop -\nment of polyps. Osteomas are most commonly found in \nthe skull and mandible. They appear in childhood prior \nto the development of polyps. Young children may have \nmany small 3- to 5-mm cysts on the chest, back, and upper  \narms. Subcutaneous encapsulated fibromas occur on the \nscalp, shoulders, arms, and back.\nDesmoid tumors and dental abnormalities have a sig -\nnificant impact on patients with Gardner\u2019s syndrome. \nDesmoid tumors represent benign, diffuse proliferation \nof soft fibrous tissue. They are abdominal wall tumors \nthat may grow to several centimeters in size. They fre -\nquently occur at sites of trauma or surgery, but may \narise de novo. Desmoid tumors are locally aggressive \nand have led to death. Mesenteric fibrosis occurs in a \nsimilar fashion. The dental abnormalities include odon -\ntomas, dentigenous cysts, unerupted teeth, congenital \nabsence of teeth, and supernumerary teeth. Congenital \nhypertrophy of the retinal pigmented epithelium has \nbeen described in up to 90% of patients. They do not \ncause visual impairment.\nDifferentiation between Gardner\u2019s syndrome and spo -\nradic epidermoid cysts is based primarily on the large \nnumbers of lesions and on a positive family history in \nGardner\u2019s syndrome patients. The presence of desmoid \ntumors should prompt consideration of the diagnosis of \nGardner\u2019s syndrome.\nEvaluation\nThe diagnosis relies primarily on clinical findings.",

Prior to Hargraves\u2019 recognition of the \nLE cell, LE was diagnosed by a constellation of clinical \nfindings. Ultimately, the American College of Rheuma -\ntology (ACR) developed a set of criteria that could be \nused for the classification of systemic lupus erythemato -\nsus (SLE). The criteria were revised in 1982 ( Table 1-1 ). \nWhen a patient fulfills four or more of the ACR criteria, \neither concurrently or serially, during any period of ob -\nservation, that patient can be classified as having SLE.\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, dermatologists first recognized \nthat most of their patients with chronic, scarring discoid \nlupus erythematosus (DLE) lesions had few, if any, sys -\ntemic findings, whereas those with malar erythema and/\nor photosensitivity frequently had systemic disease. They \nalso recognized a middle group in whom the cutaneous \nlesions were more transient than in patients with DLE, \nbut for whom the prognosis was not as poor as in those \npatients with SLE. These patients were later categorized \nas having subacute cutaneous LE (SCLE). The clas -\nsification of cutaneous LE subsets was stressed by Gil -\nliam and his coworkers. Gilliam proposed that cutane -\nous manifestations characterized by interface dermatitis \n(histopathologically- specific LE) be classified into one \nof three groups based on clinical features. An individual \nLE patient can present with more than one subtype of \nthe disease. Gilliam also recognized that LE patients can \nhave a skin disease that is not histopathologically specific (Table 1-2 ). Although each subset listed in Table 1-2  is \ngenerally predictive of outcome, it must be remembered \nthat the full spectrum of LE-associated organ dysfunc -\ntion is possible in any individual patient.\nThe prevalence of SLE is reported to be 17\u201348/100,000 \npeople. The prevalence of cutaneous LE is not well  \nestablished, but it appears to be at least as common as \nSLE. SLE has a strong female preponderance, with a 12:1 \nfemale-to-male ratio in the childbearing years.

The most common subset is discoid lupus ery -\nthematosus (DLE).

In one study, 50% of patients who received \nimmunosuppressive therapy for muscle involvement \nshowed no improvement in cutaneous manifestations. \nAlthough cutaneous disease may be of minor importance \nin patients with fulminant myositis, in many patients the \ncutaneous disease becomes the most important aspect of \nthe disorder. Most patients with cutaneous lesions are \nphotosensitive; thus, as in patients with lupus erythe \u00ad\nmatosus, the daily use of a broad\u00adspectrum sunscreen \nwith a sun protective factor of at least 50, sun protec \u00ad\ntive clothing, and a wide\u00adbrimmed hat is recommended. \nTopical modalities include corticosteroids, tacrolimus, \nor pimecrolimus. Hydroxychloroquine in doses of 200 to  \n400 mg/day is effective in select patients, providing some \ncontrol of the cutaneous disease and allowing a reduction \nin corticosteroid dosage. Patients who do not respond well \nor fully to hydroxychloroquine can be switched to chloro \u00ad\nquine 250 mg/day or can receive quinacrine 100 mg daily \nin addition given its lack of ocular toxicity. Quinacrine \nrequires compounding and may not be available in all \nlocations. The usual precautions regarding antimalarial \ntherapy should be taken, including a careful ophthalmo \u00ad\nlogic examination and follow\u00adup. It appears that  patients \nwith dermatomyositis have a greater potential than those \nwith lupus erythematosus to develop morbilliform drug \nreactions with hydroxychloroquine, and a pretreatment \nwarning is helpful. Patients with dermatomyositis who \ndevelop a cutaneous reaction to hydroxychloroquine may \ngo on to tolerate chloroquine.\nOpen\u00adlabel studies support the usefulness of metho \u00ad\ntrexate in doses between 10 and 30 mg/week and of my \u00ad\ncophenolate mofetil for the skin disease.

At this point, the dose is slowly tapered, \ngenerally over a period 1.5 to 2 times as long as the pe \u00ad\nriod of active treatment. Approximately 25% to 30% of \npatients with dermatomyositis and/or polymyositis will \nnot respond to systemic corticosteroids or will develop \nsignificant steroid\u00adrelated side effects. In these patients, \nimmunosuppressive agents (methotrexate, azathioprine, \nmycophenolate mofetil, intravenous immunoglobulin, \ncyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, or cyclosporine) may \nbe an effective means of inducing or maintaining remis \u00ad\nsion.

A characteristic feature is ghost adipocytes, which are necrotic adipocytes that have lost their nuclei and show a finely granular and basophilic ma -\nterial within their cytoplasm due to calcification. Ghost adipocytes result from the hydrolytic action of pancreatic enzymes on fat, followed by calcium deposition, a process known as saponification. Although characteristic of PP, ghost adipocytes have also been recently found as a his -\ntopathologic feature in lesions of subcutaneous mucormy -\ncosis. Finally, in late-stage lesions of PP, the fat lobule is replaced by a granulomatous inflammatory infiltrate com -\nposed of foamy histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells.\nTreatment of PP is primarily directed toward manag -\ning the underlying pancreatic disease; however, support-ive measures such as compression and elevation can also be helpful.\nAlpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency \nPanniculitis\nAlpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency is an uncommon \ncause of panniculitis. In this genetic disorder, defective production of A1AT, a serine protease inhibitor protein produced in the liver, allows for accumulation of abnor -\nmal A1AT in hepatocytes as well as decreased A1AT ac -\ntivity in the lungs, where the protein typically protects the pulmonary tissue from neutrophil elastase. Systemic manifestations may include chronic liver disease with cirrhosis, emphysema, pancreatitis, membranoprolifera-tive glomerulonephritis, rheumatoid arthritis, antineu -\ntrophil cytoplasmic antibody-positive vasculitis, other cutaneous vasculitides, and angioedema. In this genetic disorder, the most severe manifestations arise in patients with profound proteinase inhibitor deficiency, although the panniculitis can also occur in heterozygotes. The initiating event in individuals who develop panniculitis is not always clear; trauma-related and postpartum flares of the disease have been reported in genetically suscep -\ntible individuals. Clinically, large, erythematous to pur -\npuric, tender nodules or plaques appear in a variety of sites, especially the lower trunk and proximal extremi -\nties. Frequently, ulcers develop and may be deep and necrotic, accompanied by an oily discharge. Healing is accompanied by scarring and subcutaneous atrophy. The clinical course is often prolonged, and lesions are usually resistant to therapy.\nOn histopathology, early stages show a neutrophilic \npanniculitis, followed rapidly by necrosis and destruction of fat lobules. Splaying of neutrophils between collagen bundles in the deeper reticular dermis has been described as an early clue to the diagnosis. Dissolution of dermal collagen, with resultant liquefactive necrosis and separa -\ntion of fat lobules from adjacent septa, is a key feature in most cases. Another characteristic finding is the presence of \u201cskip areas\u201d of normal fat adjacent to foci of severe necrotizing panniculitis.\nThe most effective therapeutic measure is replacement \nof A1AT via intravenous infusions. Dosages are generally \n60 mg/kg per week, administered over a period of 3 to \n7 weeks. Improvement is relatively rapid, and clearing of \nthe panniculitis can occur after only a few weekly doses. Recurrences are possible when A1AT levels fall below \n50 mg/dL, but these typically respond to further replace -\nment therapy. Other successful therapies include plasma exchange, carbamazepine, doxycycline, dapsone, and liv-er transplantation. Reduction of alcohol intake has also been recommended, since ethanol (as a hepatotoxin) may precipitate A1AT-associated hepatitis. Cigarette smok-ing must also be strictly avoided in patients with A1AT deficiency.\nLipoatrophy\nLipoatrophy and lipodystrophy are often used as syn -\nonyms; however, even though both disorders lead to a loss of subcutaneous fat, they are pathogenically differ-ent entities. Lipoatrophy refers to loss of subcutaneous fat due to a previous inflammatory process involving the subcutis, while lipodystrophy is applied to an absence of subcutaneous fat with no evidence of inflammation.",

The term \u201cexfoliative dermatitis\u201d is used in some contexts and is often considered to be the same en -\ntity, but erythroderma is a more encompassing and often favored term. Numerous conditions can result in erythro -\nderma, and identifying the exact inciting cause or under -\nlying pathology may be challenging. Extreme disruption in the barrier function of the skin can lead to systemic manifestations such as fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, tachycardia, and problems with thermoregulation. Man -\nagement of erythroderma should be focused on treatment of the underlying cause, if possible, in addition to support -\nive care for the skin and systemic manifestations.\nThe incidence of erythroderma is difficult to deter -\nmine given lack of standardized reporting, and the inci -\ndence likely varies depending on location. In the United States and Europe, the incidence has been estimated to be between 1 and 2 cases per 100,000 individuals/year, but some reports from India have reported an incidence as high as 35 cases per 100,000 dermatologic outpatients. Erythroderma is more commonly seen in patients older than 45  years, with an average age of 55  years, which may \nbe related to an increase in conditions that result in eryth-roderma in older individuals. There also appears to be a male predominance, with males being affected 2 to 3 times more often than females.\nCAUSE AND PATHOGENESIS\nErythroderma represents a final clinical endpoint for many dermatological and systemic disease states ( Table 14-1). \nThe most common causes are exacerbation of an underly -\ning skin disease such as psoriasis or atopic dermatitis, a drug hypersensitivity reaction, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma; however, many cases are considered idiopathic, as an incit-ing cause is not identified. Erythroderma is likely secondary to a complex interaction of cytokines and cellular adhesion molecules affecting T-cells within the skin. Keratinocytes and Langerhans cells both produce IL-1, which increases vascular permeability, acts as a chemotactic factor for T-cells, and upregulates ICAM-1. ICAM-1 is found on ve -\nnous endothelial cells and plays an important role in T-cell binding to both endothelial cells and keratinocytes. This complex interaction of T-cells and cytokines leads to the erythema and desquamation seen clinically. Increased cell turnover in the epidermis occurs secondary to an increase in both the number of proliferative cells and the mitotic rate. These rapidly shed epidermal cells contain amino ac -\nids and proteins normally retained by the skin, leading to significantly higher than normal levels of protein loss.\nExacerbation of an underlying skin disease is a com -\nmon cause of erythroderma. Psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, stasis dermatitis, and seborrheic der -\nmatitis can all lead to erythroderma. Psoriatic erythroder -\nma can be triggered by abrupt withdrawal of a systemic medication, including oral corticosteroids, addition of a new medication, topical irritants such as tar or photo -\ntherapy burns, pregnancy, or systemic illness. Erythro -\ndermic psoriasis can present with extensive involvement of characteristic psoriatic plaques ( Fig. 14-1) or with dif -\nfuse erythroderma, often with small pustules or coalesc -\ning \u201clakes\u201d of pus. Erythroderma from atopic dermatitis tends to present as part of a chronic course with extensive lichenification following an uncontrolled flare, but may also present with a more acute erythroderma. New-onset pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) is another important con-sideration in the differential diagnosis of erythroderma. Lesions in PRP tend to have an orange-red hue and are classically separated by islands of sparing ( Fig. 14-2). The \neruption typically starts on the face or scalp and spreads downwards, with an associated palmoplantar keratoder-ma. Photosensitivity is a common feature.",

Accumulation of its substrate, protoporphyrin \n(PP), leads to immediate cutaneous photosensitivity and \nto hepatobiliary disease. Overproduced primarily in bone \nmarrow erythroid precursor cells, intracellular PP diffus -\nes into blood plasma, thereby reaching other tissues. PP \nis cleared from plasma and secreted into bile by the liver, \nthen excreted in feces. PP-rich bile facilitates gallstone \nformation. Hepatotoxic effects of PP can lead to fatal he -\npatic dysfunction. Anemia, if present, is typically mild.\nThe predominant EPP genotype is one mutant FECH  \nallele encoding a defective enzyme protein with little or \nno function, paired with a relatively common polymorphic \nallele with low gene expression that only mildly reduces \nthe activity of its enzyme product. Some authorities call \nthis \u201cpseudodominant\u201d or \u201csemidominant\u201d inheritance, \nwhile others consider it autosomal recessive, in that disease \nexpression requires anomalies in both alleles.

In addition, it is more prevalent in patients with \nlongstanding disease and a history of poor glycemic con -\ntrol, although diabetic dermopathy can be seen preceding \nthe onset of diabetes.\nPathogenesis\nAlthough the exact mechanism of pathogenesis is un -\nknown, microangiopathy with associated capillary chang -\nes is thought to cause diabetic dermopathy.\nTreatment\nDiabetic dermopathy is self-limited, and lesions heal \nspontaneously over time, leaving behind scars that are \natrophic and often hyperpigmented. There is no known \neffective therapy aside from prevention of secondary \ninfection, and no correlation has been established be -\ntween glycemic control and the development of diabetic \n dermopathy.Diabetic Foot\nDescription\nDiabetic foot is a condition that involves neuropathic \nfoot deformity in diabetic patients, and is characterized \nby the presence of peripheral neuropathy, Charcot ar -\nthropathy, and peripheral vascular disease. Peripheral \nneuropathy can lead to mal perforans, or neuropathic \nulcers, which are nonpainful ulcerations. Typically, a \nthick callus forms over bony prominences and areas \nof repeated trauma, which breaks down over time to \nform an ulcer. The most common sites of involvement \nare the bony prominences of the foot and ankle. Infec -\ntion and gangrene are potential serious complications \n(Fig. 24-3 ). Charcot arthropathy in diabetic patients \ninvolves progressive deterioration of weight-bearing \njoints, usually observed in the ankle and hindfoot. \nClawing deformities of the toes are other sequelae of \ndiabetic neuropathy, thought to be due to intrinsic \nmuscle atrophy leading to muscle imbalance.\nEpidemiology\nPeripheral neuropathy and subsequent ulcers account \nfor significant morbidity and mortality in the diabetic \npopulation. The lifetime risk of developing a diabetic \nulcer is estimated to be 15% to 25% among diabetic pa -\ntients. In addition, 80% of major nontraumatic amputa -\ntions performed in the US are in diabetic patients, 85% \nof whom presented with a preceding foot ulcer. Neuro -\npathic arthropathy, a significant risk for limb loss, is seen \nin up to 10% of patients with neuropathy, and affects \nbilateral lower extremities in approximately one-third of \npatients.\nPathogenesis\nDiabetic foot is a result of atherosclerosis of lower ex -\ntremity arteries, abnormalities in sensory, motor, and \nFIGURE 24-2  n Diabetic dermopathy.\nFIGURE 24-3  n Diabetic foot changes secondary to peripheral \nneuropathy.",

As many as 80% of patients with LABD have oral involvement. It is also known as linear IgA disease, IgA pemphigoid, and linear DH. The distinction between LABD, BP, and DH \nwas made in 1979 by Chorzelski et  al. based on direct im -\nmunofluorescence findings, which demonstrated linear depositions of IgA along the BMZ in LABD.\nClassification\nChronic bullous disease of childhood (CBDC) and LABD share the same histology and immunofluorescence find-ings. Although they have different clinical presentations, they are considered by most experts to be the same disease.\nCBDC occurs in children, with a peak incidence at \n4.5 years, and tends to remit by age 13. The character -\nistic distribution is the lower abdomen and perineum, although the extremities can be involved. Blisters occur in the so-called \u201ccluster of jewels\u201d configuration, because new lesions appear at the periphery of old ones. Mucosal involvement is reported in 64% of cases.LABD shows a slight female preponderance, with peak \nincidence at 60 to 65  years. Its clinical picture often re -\nsembles DH, with pruritic papules and vesicles on the extremities; however, larger vesicles and bullae similar to those of BP may occur. These may be linear or \u201csausage shaped.\u201d In about 60% of patients LABD may remit over several years.\nLABD is unique in that it may be induced by drugs, \nand may remit after withdrawal of the offending drug. Vancomycin is the most common association, but others include amiodarone, ampicillin, captopril, childhood vaccinations, diclofenac, interferon- \u03b3, in-\nterleukin-2, iodine, lithium, penicillin G, phenytoin, piroxicam, rifampin, somatostatin, and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole. The pathogenesis of this reaction is not understood.\nPathogenesis\nIn 1990 Zone et  al. identified a 97-kDa protein antigen \nrecognized in adult and childhood sera from LABD pa -\ntients. This protein is identical to the extracellular por -\ntion of collagen XVII (BPAG2, BP180). This protein represents a proteolytic fragment of the shed ectodo -\nmain of BPAG2. The mechanism by which IgA base -\nment membrane antibodies cause blistering is yet to be elucidated.\nSome patients show linear IgA and linear IgG along \nthe basement membrane, and this is thought to repre -\nsent an immunologic overlap of LABD and BP. These patients should be treated according to the predominant antibody pattern.\nNumerous case reports link LABD to Hodgkin\u2019s disease \nand other B-cell lymphomas. Transitional cell cancer of the bladder and esophageal cancer have also been report -\ned in association with LABD. Because IgA is among the antibodies deposited at the basement membrane in SLE, it is not clear whether the association between LABD and SLE is a true one. There is a real association between ulcerative colitis and LABD: in fact, one study showed ul -\ncerative colitis present in five of 70 patients with LABD. Other disease associations include multiple sclerosis, der-matomyositis, Crohn\u2019s disease, hydatidiform mole, and rheumatoid arthritis.\nMultiple drugs have been reported to induce LABD. \nThe reaction usually occurs within days to weeks of in -\ngestion. The most common medication is vancomycin, although penicillins, cephalosporins, ACE inhibitors, and NSAIDs have been reported. Several other medications have been described to produce LABD on rare occasions. A detailed medication history is indicated for all patients \nwith LABD. Most cases resolve in 2 to 6  weeks after dis -\ncontinuation of the offending drug.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThe differential diagnosis of LABD is similar to that of the other immunobullous diseases discussed in this chap -\nter.",

Phenolphthalein may also be present in mara -\nschino cherries and other nontraditional exposures.

The exact \npathogenic mechanisms remain unknown; however, there \nis evidence that it is a lymphocyte CD8-mediated reaction, \nwherein the offending drug may induce local reactivation \nof memory T-cell lymphocytes localized in epidermal and \ndermal tissues and targeted initially by the viral infection.The lesions appear as pruritic, well-demarcated ery -\nthematous, sometimes bullous macules and plaques.

Supporting \nconcepts and important clinical examples follow each \nprinciple. Two broad categories overriding these prin -\nciples are drug selection and monitoring.\nPRINCIPLES OF DRUG SELECTION\nPrinciple 1. Systemic Drugs with an \nElement of Risk Are Essential in the \nManagement of Numerous Dermatoses\nMany dermatologic therapies are administered through \nrelatively safe topical routes. In addition, there are a \nnumber of systemic drugs for which there are few signifi -\ncant risks and which therefore require little or no routine monitoring for adverse effects ( Table 48-1 ). This chapter \nfocuses on the systemic drugs with a significant element \nof risk that are commonly used to treat more serious der -\nmatologic conditions ( Table 48-2 ).\nPrinciple 2. It Is Important Initially to \nMake a Reasonable Estimation of the \nCutaneous Disease \u201cSeverity\u201d\nThere are a number of dermatologic conditions in which \ndisease severity and associated risks are self-evident. Blis -\ntering diseases such as pemphigus vulgaris and blistering \ndrug reactions such as toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) \nhave well-established risks. Malignancies that are multi -\ncentric at the outset, such as cutaneous T-cell lympho -\nma (mycosis fungoides), represent another example of \nhigh-risk dermatoses. At times, the dermatologic risk is a \nfunction of the systemic findings associated with the der -\nmatologic signs of internal disease. Systemic lupus ery -\nthematosus, sarcoidosis, drug reaction with eosinophilia \nand systemic symptoms (DRESS), and dermatomyositis \nare appropriate examples. The severe irreversible ocular \nmucosal morbidity with mucous membrane pemphigoid \nalso presents a noteworthy risk.\nIt is more difficult to determine disease severity and \nrisk in conditions without life-threatening potential and \nwithout severe irreversible morbidity. Dermatologists are \ncommonly confronted with the psychosocial risk and/or \nfunctional impairment presented by patients with severe \nacne vulgaris or psoriasis. In these cases the patient and \nphysician collectively will have to determine if appro -\npriate systemic drug therapy with an element of risk is \nwarranted.\nDermatologic conditions in which the morbidity re -\nsults in a loss of work can also justify potentially risky \nsystemic therapy. Pyoderma gangrenosum is an example \nof such a condition.\nPrinciple 3. \u201cRisk\u2013Risk\u201d Analysis Is \nPerformed by Comparing the Risk(s) of \na Given Disease (As Defined Earlier) \nwith the Inherent Risk(s) of the Proposed \nSystemic Drug Therapy. The Treatment \nRisks Should Not Exceed the Inherent \nUntreated Disease Risk\nThe risk\u2013risk analysis may be preferable to the risk\u2013 benefit \nratio, which is traditionally discussed.

Successful treatment of recalcitrant \nPG with goserelin-induced chemical oophorectomy or \nritodrine has been reported.\nThough PG improves late in pregnancy, the disease \ncharacteristically flares at delivery or early postpartum \nin up to 75% of patients. The duration of PG postpar -\ntum widely varies, ranging from 5 weeks to 18 months. \nPatients who develop prolonged disease tend to have \ngreater age, higher parity, more generalized lesions, and \na history of PG in previous pregnancies. Breastfeeding \nmay shorten duration of active lesions. PG recurs in 95% \nof subsequent pregnancies and may be earlier in onset \nand more severe during recurrences. PG also recurs with \nmenses and oral contraceptive use in 12% to 64% and \n20% to 50%, respectively.\nPG is associated with increased maternal risk of Graves\u2019 \ndisease ( \u223c14%). Small cohorts have shown an association with low birth weight and preterm delivery, which cor -\nrelated with severity of PG and not corticosteroid use. \nFetal complications are thought to be due to low-grade \nplacental insufficiency. No increase in fetal mortality has \nbeen documented, with the exception of one case of fetal \n cerebral hemorrhage. Transient vesiculobullous lesions \noccur in 5% to 10% of neonates secondary to passive \ntransplacental transfer of maternal PG antibodies.\nPolymorphic Eruption of Pregnancy\nPolymorphic eruption of pregnancy (PEP, pruritic urti -\ncarial papules and plaques of pregnancy [PUPPP], late-\nonset prurigo of pregnancy, toxic erythema of pregnancy, \ntoxemic rash of pregnancy) is the most common specific \ndermatosis of pregnancy, occurring in 1:160 to 1:200 \npregnancies. PEP classically affects primigravids (73%) \nwith onset in the third trimester. Onset in other trimes -\nters or postpartum has also been reported. Additional \nrisk factors for polymorphic eruption include multiple \ngestations (10-fold increase), increased maternal weight \ngain and male fetus (2:1 risk, 55% of cases).\nThe pathogenesis of PEP is unclear. Association with \nincreased maternal weight gain and multiple gestations \nlends support to the proposed theory that rapid disten -\nsion of the abdominal wall (and/or a reaction to the dis -\ntension) may incite the inflammatory process of PEP. \nFetal DNA has been detected in PEP lesions raising \nquestions about potential relevance of microchimerism \nto pathogenesis.\nCharacteristically, PEP begins as pruritic, erythema -\ntous urticarial papules within the abdominal striae dis -\ntensae (two-thirds of patients); there is clear sparing of \nthe immediate periumbilical skin (in contrast to PG)  \n(Fig. 41-3 ).

Another typical  \nexample is represented by ALCL. Prognosis in nodal cas -\nes depends heavily on ALK expression, with ALK+ cases showing a disease-specific 5-year survival approaching 80%, and ALK\u2212 ones characterized by a 5-year survival of approximately 50%. By contrast, cALCL is characterized by an excellent prognosis (5-year survival >90%) in spite of ALK-negativity in the vast majority of cases. In short, cutaneous lymphomas should be evaluated keeping in mind that distinction of primary from secondary cases is paramount for proper management of most patients. Ac -\ncurate history, clinical examination of the entire skin, and histopathologic, phenotypic, and molecular analyses are required for a precise diagnosis (see also the paragraphs on primary cutaneous lymphomas earlier in this chapter).\nIn general, specific skin manifestations of extracutane-\nous lymphomas retain the histopathologic and pheno-typic features of the original tumor. Dedifferentiation or blastic progression, however, may be observed in some cases (e.g., in cutaneous Richter\u2019s syndrome, representing in many cases large cell transformation of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia [B-CLL]). In these instances, the cutaneous manifestations show different morphology and phenotype compared to the original extracutaneous tumor.\nClinical features of extracutaneous lymphomas pre -\nsenting with specific skin manifestations are mostly nondescript papules and nodules, often ulcerated, and usually do not present features pathognomonic of a spe-cific disease. In some cases lesions may be located in the skin areas drained by affected lymph nodes, but in most  \ninstances they are disseminated or localized at sites unre -\nlated anatomically to the original tumor.\nMost cases of secondary specific skin manifestations \nof extracutaneous lymphomas represent a marker of pro -\ngression of the disease with poor prognosis (stage IV). One exception is represented by cutaneous lesions of B-CLL, which may be observed at sites of skin tumors or of other inflammatory conditions, representing recruit-ment of neoplastic cells in the course of immunologic responses. For example, infection by Borrelia burgdorferi \nin patients with B-CLL can be characterized by the on -\nset of specific cutaneous manifestations at sites typical for  \nBorrelia-associated lymphocytoma cutis (i.e., nipple, ear-lobe, genital area). Although the infiltrate shows histo-pathologic, phenotypic, and molecular features of the leukemic disease, these specific manifestations are not associated with a poor prognosis, and patients should be managed conservatively.\nA discussion of clinicopathologic features of specific \nskin manifestations of each extracutaneous lymphoma is beyond the scope of this chapter, thus only a few remarks on some entities will be provided in what follows.\nCutaneous B-cell Chronic Lymphocytic \nLeukemia (B-CLL)\nThe skin is a frequent site of specific manifestations in \npatients with B-CLL. As already mentioned, in many in -\nstances cutaneous lesions should not be considered as a sign of progression and/or of poor prognosis, as they rep -\nresent migration of neoplastic leukemic cells to sites of skin inflammation. Large cell transformation (Richter\u2019s syndrome, representing either the same neoplastic clone with morphologic transformation or an unrelated second large B-cell lymphoma) can be observed in the skin, and can represent the first sign of progression of the disease. In contrast to most skin manifestations of B-CLL, cuta -\nneous Richter\u2019s syndrome (as Richter\u2019s syndrome arising at extracutaneous sites) is invariably associated with very poor prognosis.\nPatients with specific skin manifestations of B-CLL \nshould be managed according to the hematologic fea -\ntures. As already mentioned, specific infiltrates located at sites of cutaneous inflammation do not require aggressive treatment.\nCutaneous Myelogenous Leukemia (cML)\nSpecific skin lesions can be observed in all subtypes of ML, including both acute and chronic forms of the  \ndisease, as well as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). In some patients cutaneous lesions arise before the leukemia is known, and represent the first manifestation of the dis -\nease.

Unlike other vascular \ntumors and malformations, infantile hemangiomas ex -\npress the placental marker glucose transporter protein-1 \n(GLUT-1). These hemangiomas typically mark out their \nterritory early on and subsequently expand in volume. \nThe proliferative phase lasts until 3 to 9 months of age, \nwith the most rapid growth in the first few months. This \nis followed by slow spontaneous regression during the \ninvolutional phase, which is complete by 3 to 10 years \nof age. Superficial hemangiomas are initially bright red \nin color and then become dull red to gray during in -\nvolution, whereas deep hemangiomas are light blue in color and become softer and less warm as they involute.  \nThe term \u201ccavernous hemangioma,\u201d which has been \nused to describe both hemangiomas with a deep compo -\nnent and venous malformations, has led to confusion and \nshould be avoided. Infantile hemangiomas can be compli -\ncated by ulceration, interference with the function of vital \nstructures such as the eyes or airway, high-output cardiac \nfailure, and problems related to associated regional struc -\ntural anomalies ( Table 23-3 ; see Fig. 23-16 ). Hypothy -\nroidism occasionally occurs in infants with large-volume \nproliferating hemangiomas, especially hepatic lesions, \nbecause of production of iodothyronine deiodinase with -\nin the tumors. In the past decade, use of the \u03b2-blocker \npropranolol has revolutionized the treatment of infantile \nhemangiomas that would otherwise threaten vital func -\ntions or result in disfigurement.\nThere are a variety of benign vascular tumors and re -\nactive proliferations other than infantile hemangiomas \n(Table 23-2 ). Congenital hemangiomas represent rela -\ntively uncommon, GLUT-1-negative vascular neoplasms \nthat are fully formed at birth and have a natural history of \neither rapid involution during the first year of life or pro -\nportionate growth and failure to involute.

Likewise, populations of European descent with \nallotype HLA-B*5801 have increased incidence of allo -\npurinol-induced SJS/TEN. These allotypes may be ge -\nnetic markers or could be involved in the pathogenesis \nof the mucocutaneous syndromes. The US Food and \nDrug Administration recommends that patients of East \nAsian descent have testing for the HLA-B*1502 geno -\ntype prior to receiving carbamazepine .\nThe crucial mediator of keratinocyte apoptosis in the \nmucocutaneous reactions appears to be granulysin, a \nmolecule found in the cytotoxic granules of CD8+, NK, \nand NK/T cells, which is capable of causing membrane \ninstability and destruction resulting in cell death. In -\ncreased levels of granulysin are found in TEN  blisters as \nwell as serum and correlate with disease severity. Mul -\ntiple other factors are implicated in the disease patho -\ngenesis of SJS and TEN as well, including death recep -\ntor Fas (CD95), soluble Fas ligand (FasL) produced \nby peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and FasL on epidermal keratinocytes, cytotoxic T cells, and NK cells. \nInteraction of Fas and FasL induces signaling, which \nrapidly leads to apoptosis. Antibodies present in pooled \nhuman intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) may block \nFas-mediated keratinocyte death, and use of IVIg for \ntreatment of TEN rests on this theory. Markers of oxi -\ndative stress are also elevated in TEN patients, and may \nresult from TNF- \u03b1- and IFN- \u03b3-induced production \nof nitric oxide within inflammatory cells and keratino -\ncytes. Other  inflammatory mediators found elevated in \nTEN patients include alarmins, TRAIL (TNF- related \n apoptosis-inducing ligand), TWEAK (TNF-related  \nweak apoptosis inducer), alpha-defensins, and granzyme \nB and perforin released by cytolytic T cells.\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\nThe current classification of EM, SJS, and TEN is based \non consensus definitions published in 1993. An interna -\ntional group reviewed hundreds of historical cases and \nagreed upon clinical definitions based on pattern and \ndistribution of skin lesions and maximum extent of skin \ndetachment. The consensus group determined that EM \ndiffered significantly enough from SJS and TEN that \nit represented its own clinical group, and SJS and TEN \nwere variants of a single disease. However, while there is \ngeneral agreement that EM represents a different disease, \nmany believe that within the SJS and TEN spectrum exist \ntwo distinct diseases with different clinical presentations. \nAdditionally, a mycoplasma-induced rash and mucositis \nsyndrome may exist, distinct from EM/SJS and charac -\nterized by a mild disease course. Thus, the diagnosis of \nEM, SJS, and TEN is often debated and different clinical \nclassifications exist .\nErythema Multiforme\nEM begins with either a mild prodrome of malaise and \nlow-grade fever or no systemic involvement at all. Skin \nlesions are often target-appearing ( Fig. 11-1 ) with three \nconcentric zones, most commonly: (1) a central dusky \narea, (2) a middle pink or edematous zone, and (3) an \nouter red ring. Although target lesions are characteristic \nof EM, lesions need only be monomorphic for an EM \ndiagnosis, and target lesions themselves are not diagnos -\ntic for EM. Target lesions can be seen in viral-induced \neruptions and may not show the characteristic histology \nnecessary to confirm a diagnosis of EM. Lesions may \nbe asymptomatic to burning or pruritic, last from 1 to \n2 weeks, and tend to evolve to have a dusky appearance. \nMucosal surfaces may be involved in EM ( Fig. 11-2 ), and \nmucosal involvement can occur in the absence of skin \nlesions.",

These will not be discussed further.\nSPOROTRICHOSIS\nSporotrichosis, caused by Sporothrix schenckii , has world -\nwide distribution, but occurs most commonly in warm, \nhumid areas where conditions favor its saprophytic \ngrowth. The organism typically enters the skin through \nminor injuries with plant materials, such as rose thorns, \nsphagnum moss, and damp straw, on which the fungus \ngrows . Rarely, Sporothrix  spores may be inhaled, causing \npulmonary infection with subsequent cutaneous dissemi -\nnation. Currently, the largest disease clusters of any type \nof sporotrichosis are among children in Brazil\u2019s urban \nslums, where feral cats serve as the reservoir.\nClinical Manifestations\nClassic sporotrichosis begins as a small painless papule \nat the inoculation site ( Fig. 33-1 ). Lesions usually evolve \ninto firm, violaceous, dermal nodules. The surface may \nulcerate, forming a sporotrichotic chancre with a ragged \nnecrotic base, surrounded by epitheliomatous hyperplasia. \nWhen primary lesions are on distal extremities, local exten -\nsion, called sporotrichoid spread, may occur via cutaneous \nlymphatic channels. This produces an ascending chain of \neither smooth dermal nodules or of ulcerating subcutane -\nous nodules ( Fig. 33-2 ). Lesions are most common on the \nhands and arms, but fixed centrofacial disease may occur \nin children, especially those with cat exposure ( Fig. 33-3 ).\nDisseminated sporotrichosis is rare; it requires hema -\ntogenous dissemination from either primary cutaneous \ninfection or primary inhalational disease. The most com -\nmon extracutaneous sites are lungs, bones, and meninges. \nRisk factors for dissemination include hematologic/lym -\nphoreticular malignancies, alcoholism, immunosuppres -\nsive medications, and AIDS.\nDiagnosis\nBecause Sporothrix  organisms are usually sparse in tis -\nsue, histopathologic diagnosis of sporotrichosis has low \nsensitivity .

As in advanced MF, allogeneic stem cell transplantation may represent a successful option for patients with SS as well.\nPrimary Cutaneous CD30+ \nLymphoproliferative Disorders (pcCD30+LD)\npcCD30+LD include lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) and \ncutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (cALCL). These diseases are considered as two ends of a spectrum without clear-cut boundaries. In many cases precise classification can be achieved only upon careful clinicopathologic correlation. Both LyP and cALCL arise predominantly in adults, but LyP is the second most frequent type of cutaneous lympho -\nma in children after MF. pcCD30+LD are characterized by a very good prognosis, and should be clearly separated from nodal ALCL with cutaneous involvement, as treatment and prognosis are completely different.\ncALCL usually presents with solitary, commonly ul -\ncerated tumors ( Fig. 20-1).

Terry nails are characterized by a nail \nplate that is opaque white with the exception of the distal \nportion, which retains its normal pink color ( Fig. 30-5 ). \nIn addition, patients may develop transverse white bands \n(Muehrcke nails), clubbed nails, or koilonychia (spoon-\nshaped nails), but none of these changes is specific for he -\npatic disease. Changes in body hair are common and are \nnoted primarily in men. The axillary, pubic, and pectoral \nhair is usually sparse, but thinning of all body hair is also \ncommon. There is often the development of a female pu -\nbic hair pattern, coinciding with other evidence of femi -\nnization, including testicular softening and gynecomastia. \nThis is in contrast to the hypertrichosis seen in patients \nwith porphyria cutanea tarda and liver disease.\nThere are a number of nonspecific systemic symptoms \nassociated with cirrhosis of the liver, including weakness, \nanorexia, nausea, weight loss, and abdominal discomfort. \nPruritus is less common in patients with intrahepatic cho -\nlestasis and occurs more often in diseases such as primary \nbiliary cirrhosis, sclerosing cholangitis, and chronic extra -\nhepatic biliary obstruction. The cirrhotic liver is usually \nsmall, firm, and nodular, and the spleen is often enlarged. \nAscites may cause a remarkable distension of the abdomi -\nnal cavity. Low albumin occurs in the setting of chronic \nhepatic dysfunction and results in edema, especially of the \nlower extremities. This can lead to stasis dermatitis and \nxerosis of the skin in areas of chronic edema. As a result \nof impaired hepatic function, a prothrombin deficiency \nmay develop, resulting in cutaneous purpura, epistaxis, \nand gingival bleeding. This deficiency also causes diffi -\nculty in controlling the bleeding from varices. The use of \nintramuscular vitamin K to help reverse the prothrombin \ndeficiency has led to rare reports of unusual annular ery -\nthematous reactions surrounding the injection site.\nA review of the diagnosis, course, treatment, and prog -\nnosis of cirrhosis is beyond the scope of this book. There \nis, however, one additional point concerning cirrhosis that is especially important for dermatologists, and this is \nthe potential inducement of the disease with methotrexate \nused to treat psoriasis or other dermatologic conditions. \nMethotrexate-induced hepatic changes are now believed \nto be more associated with obesity that is often present \nin patients with psoriasis. They are also more likely with \nincreasing dosage and duration of therapy. Cirrhosis is \nunusual in patients treated with methotrexate who do \nnot have other risk factors for hepatic disease. Factors \nthat increase the propensity for cirrhosis in patients tak -\ning methotrexate include obesity, steatohepatitis, diabetes \nmellitus, hyperlipidemia, hepatitis A, B, or C, concomi -\ntant potentially hepatotoxic medications such as acet -\naminophen, statins, systemic antifungals, and/or excessive \nalcohol intake. It has been suggested that in the absence \nof other risk factors, patients on methotrexate may not \nneed liver biopsies. Several guidelines exist for the deci -\nsion to perform a liver biopsy, but recently, noninvasive \ntechniques have been used more frequently to follow pa -\ntients receiving long-term methotrexate therapy. Levels \nof the amino terminal peptide of type III procollagen \nhave been used extensively in Europe, particularly the \nUnited Kingdom, for evaluation of the liver in order to \ndetect early fibrosis, but this test is not readily available \nin the United States.

Characteristic fibrofolliculoma facial lesions be -\ngin in the third decade as small white to skin-colored flat papules, and may range from a few scattered lesions to near-confluent involvement of the face and neck ( Fig. \n17-11).

The most characteristic findings of Cowden disease are trichilemmomas located around the nose and central face, multiple keratotic papules on the face, neck, ears, and hands, and multiple papules on the oral mucosa that coalesce to form a cobblestone appearance. Systemic manifestations include polyposis of the gastrointestinal tract, tumors of the thyroid gland, ovarian cysts, and fi -\nbrocystic disease of the breast. All of these syndromes are associated with germline mutations in the PTEN  \ngene (10q23.3) and an increased risk of malignancy in several organ systems. Women are at very high risk of breast cancer, often bilateral, but men with Cowden dis -\nease are at risk of breast malignancy as well.

Patients with Gardner\u2019s syndrome de -\nvelop epidermoid cysts, fibromas, lipomas, and desmoid tumors. Multiple osteomas may develop. Bilateral con-genital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium is an early ocular finding. Epidermoid cysts appear in early childhood on the face, trunk, and scalp, and may precede the identification of colonic polyposis by many years. Concern for malignant transformation of the pol-yps often leads to prophylactic total colectomy in child -\nhood. Patients are also at risk of neoplasia of other organ systems, particularly central nervous system malignancy (Turcot syndrome).",

Patients with this form of psoriasis \ngenerally feel unwell. They have difficulties maintain -\ning thermoregulation, and are often hypohidrotic due to \n occlusion of the sweat ducts. High-output cardiac fail -\nure may occur given the increased blood flow to the skin \nsurface.\nPustular psoriasis is an uncommon presentation of \npsoriasis. Several variants exist, including generalized \npustular psoriasis, acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau, \nannular pustular psoriasis, and palmoplantar pustulosis \n(Fig. 6-4 ). Generalized pustular psoriasis is the most se -\nvere form. This is an acute form characterized by fevers \nthat last several days followed by a sudden eruption of \nsterile pustules 3 to 4 mm in size. The pustules arise on \nerythematous skin that may become confluent. Char -\nacteristically this form occurs in waves of fevers and \npustules. It may resolve spontaneously, although treat -\nment is usually required given the severe nature of this \neruption. Generalized pustular psoriasis can occur on \nthe background of chronic plaque psoriasis, is com -\nmonly triggered by withdrawal of treatments especially \nsystemic steroids, and has been shown to be associ -\nated with CARD14 mutations. Whereas spontaneous \npustular psoriasis is associated with mutations in the \nIL-36 receptor antagonist ( IL36RN ), suggesting that \nit belongs within the spectrum of autoinflammatory \ndiseases.\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\nDifferential diagnosis depends on the specific subtype \nof psoriasis ( Table 6-2 ). A large number of conditions can have manifestations that resemble psoriasis but \noften can be distinguished on clinical grounds alone. \nWhere diagnosis is questionable clinically, a biopsy is \nindicated.\nTREATMENT\nA discussion of the full spectrum of therapies for psoriasis \nis beyond the scope of this chapter. We will pass over dis -\ncussion of topical therapies and phototherapy and focus \non the basics of systemic therapy and the potential effect \non systemic disease.\nFIGURE 6-2  n Guttate psoriasis in a young child following a strep \ninfection.\nA\nB\nFIGURE 6-3  n Erythrodermic psoriasis.

The rash tends \nto involve the trunk and the extremities for the duration of \nthe febrile episode. For patients with MA, in  addition to the \nfebrile episodes, they may have psychomotor retardation, \nfacial dysmorphia, cataracts, and failure to thrive.\nEvaluation\nDuring febrile episodes inflammatory markers are elevat -\ned such as CRP and SAA. The majority of patients will \nhave an elevated IgD although a low/normal level does \nnot exclude HIDS. They may also have a slightly elevated \nurinary mevalonic acid level. In between attacks all labs \nmay be normal . The definitive diagnostic test is to look \nfor MVK  mutations.\nTreatment\nSimvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, which \nreduces mevalonate levels, has been helpful in reducing \nthe duration of febrile episodes. The other treatments \nwhere favorable responses have been reported include \nprednisone, etanercept, and anakinra. Colchicine appears \nto be ineffective for HIDS.\nPYOGENIC ARTHRITIS, PYODERMA \nGANGRENOSUM AND ACNE SYNDROME\nPyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne \n(PAPA) syndrome is characterized by joint and skin in -\nflammation. Typically arthritis presents initially in the first \ndecade with variable skin expression as the patient ages.\nPathogenesis\nPAPA is a rare autosomal dominant autoinflammatory \nsyndrome. It is caused by mutations in the PSTPIP1  gene. \nThis encodes CD2 binding protein 1, which interacts \nwith pyrin. The mutated protein exhibits greater affinity \nwith pyrin, which leads to dysregulation of IL-1 \u03b2 pro-\nduction. Genotypic analysis of affected families has dem -\nonstrated variable penetrance with some family members \nwithout any apparent symptoms.\nClinical Features\nThe typical presenting sign of the disease is aseptic, \n recurrent, painful monoarthritis in the first decade. The \njoints most commonly affected are the elbows, knees, \nand ankles, which may result in significant joint destruc -\ntion over time. Severe nodulocystic acne and pyoderma \ngangrenosum (PG) may develop in puberty ( Fig. 8-7 ). \nSkin disease may well persist into adulthood. A few cases \nof concomitant hidradenitis suppurativa have also been \nreported in PAPA patients.\nEvaluation\nAs with other autoinflammatory syndromes elevated \nacute phase reactants and leukocytosis may be observed. Histology from PG lesions is identical to PG not related \nto PAPA and therefore is not diagnostic. Ideally muta -\ntional analysis for the PSTPIP1  gene should be ordered.\nTreatment\nSatisfactory responses have been described from various \nTNF- \u03b1 antagonists including etanercept, adalimumab, and \ninfliximab. Blocking the IL-1 pathway with anakinra has \nalso been helpful although it may be better for joint disease \nthan cutaneous manifestations. Corticosteroids have also \nbeen useful for arthritis but their use may exacerbate acne. \nTopical and systemic retinoids in combination with biolog -\nical agents have been effective for control of the cystic acne.\nPyoderma Gangrenosum, Acne,  \nand Suppurative Hidradenitis (PASH)\nRecent reports have described a PSTPIP1 gene muta -\ntion associated syndrome distinct from PAPA . This syn -\ndrome includes dramatic hidradenitis suppurativa, along \nwith pyoderma gangrenosum and acne conglobata. This \nsyndrome presents significant therapeutic difficulty. A \ntherapeutic role for tumor necrosis factor antagonists, or \ninterleukin-1 inhibitors including anakinra has been sup -\nported by case reports.\nSAPHO SYNDROME\nSAPHO syndrome presents as osteoarticular and skin \ninflammation in childhood and young adult life. SAPHO \nstands for synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and \nosteitis. It is likely that chronic multifocal osteomyeli -\ntis, a syndrome described predominantly in a pediatric \npopulation, lies within the same clinical spectrum as \n SAPHO as they share numerous characteristics.",

MEN type 1 is associated with parathyroid adenoma in nearly all patients, as well as pituitary tumors and a variety of pancreatic neoplasms. Multiple facial angiofibromas are common in MEN 1. Collagenomas, caf\u00e9-au-lait macules, gingival papules, and lipomas are less frequent cutaneous findings. Pa-tients with MEN 2a develop parathyroid adenoma, pheochromocytoma, and medullary thyroid carcinoma. The only cutaneous manifestation of MEN 2a is lichen amyloidosis. MEN 2b is associated with mucosal and intestinal neuromatosis, pheochromocytoma, and med -\nullary thyroid carcinoma. Affected individuals present with a marfanoid habitus and coarse facial features, the latter due to neuronal infiltration of the eyelids, lips, and tongue (Fig. 17-13).\nMuir\u2013Torre Syndrome (OMIM #158320)\nMuir\u2013Torre syndrome is a variant of HNPCC Lynch syndrome II with multiple sebaceous tumors, including adenomas, adenocarcinomas, and epitheliomas. It is associated with deleterious mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes, including MLH1 and MSH2. The presence of two or more sebaceous tumors or a single sebaceous \nneoplasm in a person younger than 60  years with a \npersonal or family history of Lynch-related cancer (GI, endometrial, ovarian, urothelial, or bilial) confers a high likelihood of Muir\u2013Torre syndrome. If suggestive features are identified, mismatch repair immunohistochemistry and microsatellite instability testing of the skin tumors may be helpful to confirm the diagnosis. Although the visceral tumors in patients with Muir\u2013Torre syndrome appear to behave in a more benign fashion than similar sporadic tumors, 60% of patients with Muir\u2013Torre will develop metastatic disease. In addition, 50% of patients with Muir\u2013Torre syndrome present with an internal malignancy prior to manifesting skin lesions.

The exact mechanism of \nfollicular destruction in secondary scarring alopecia may \nbe direct compression, alteration of blood supply, or re -\nlease of injurious cytokines from infiltrating cells. Some \nexamples of diseases causing secondary scarring alopecia \nare sarcoidosis, linear morphea of the scalp (en coup de \nsabre) ( Fig. 43-10 ), and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( Fig. \n43-11 ). Infectious causes include cutaneous tuberculosis, \nleprosy, syphilis, and leishmaniasis. Visceral cancers that metastasize to the skin, including renal cell and breast \ncarcinoma, may cause scarring alopecia by crowding out \nthe hair follicles. Likewise, sufficient ischemia or pres -\nsure, radiation, and chemotherapy can lead to secondary \nscarring alopecia, as can bullous disorders such as cica -\ntricial pemphigoid and epidermolysis bullosa. Finally, \nhereditary disorders such as incontinentia pigmenti or \nkeratitis\u2013ichthyosis\u2013deafness (KID) syndrome have been \nassociated with secondary scarring alopecia ( Table 43-5 ).\nDiagnosis and Treatment\nThe skin overlying a scarring process characteristically \ndemonstrates loss of follicular markings. It may appear \nsmooth or show features of the underlying disease, for ex -\nample the dyspigmentation seen in discoid lupus erythe -\nmatosus. A biopsy, which must be taken from an area of \nactive disease rather than from one of old scarring, may be \nrequired to determine the underlying disease process. If \nbiopsy is performed, both horizontal and vertical section -\ning are recommended. Horizontal (transverse) sections al -\nlow for assessment of follicular distribution, number and \ntype, and for visualization of all follicles at different levels. \nVertical sections allow for visualization of the dermoepi -\ndermal junction and any alterations associated with the in -\nfundibular epidermis and the adjacent dermis. Additional \ntests such as elastin, PAS (periodic acid-Schiff) , and mucin \nstains as well as direct immunofluorescence may also be \nhelpful when the primary diagnosis is unclear.\nTreatment options are of limited value once scarring \nhas occurred since the hair cannot regrow once the fol -\nlicle has been replaced with a scar. Therefore, aggressive \ntherapy early in the disease course of conditions that can \nresult in scarring alopecia is critical. Therapy should be \ntargeted at controlling the underlying process with a goal \nof halting progression of loss.\nHair Shaft Disorders\nHair shaft disorders, also called trichodystrophies, may \nbe congenital or acquired.

IGF-1 is the \nmost reliable laboratory indicator of acromegaly be -\ncause of its excellent correlation with 24-hour growth \nhormone secretion. Once growth hormone hyperse -\ncretion has been confirmed, magnetic resonance imag -\ning of the pituitary is recommended. Surgical removal \nof the pituitary tumor is first-line therapy for most pa -\ntients but results in long-term cure in only about 60% \nof patients. Medical management as well as radiation therapy are therefore important complementary treat -\nments. Long-acting somatostatin analogs such as oc -\ntreotide are first-line medical therapy. Dopamine \nagonists, such as bromocriptine, and growth hormone \nreceptor antagonists may also be beneficial.\nHypopituitarism\nHypopituitarism may manifest as an isolated deficiency \nof one or more anterior pituitary hormones, resulting in \nsecondary atrophy of the gonads, thyroid, and adrenal \ncortex. Panhypopituitarism implies absence of all pitu -\nitary hormones, including growth hormone, thyrotropin, \nprolactin, corticotropin, and the two gonadotropins (FSH \nand LH). The most common cause of hypopituitarism \nin adult life is a pituitary adenoma. Other tumors, infec -\ntions (syphilis or tuberculosis), sarcoidosis, basal skull \nfracture, infarction (such as with postpartum hemorrhage \nin Sheehan syndrome), and a variety of other disorders \nmay disrupt the normal function of the gland and lead to \nhypopituitarism.\nThe endocrine manifestations of hypopituitarism \nvary with the type, age of development, and degree of \nhormone deficiency. At least 75% of the gland must be \ndestroyed before the wide variety of signs and symp -\ntoms become clinically manifest. Cutaneous changes \nmay be the first clue to the diagnosis. The skin and \nsubcutaneous tissues are thin, body hair is scant, and \nthe skin is pale or yellowish in color. Signs of hypothy -\nroidism may be evident, and there may be symptoms \nof gonadotropin deficiency, especially a reduction in \nlibido.\nAfter the diagnosis has been established by appropriate \nlaboratory studies, treatment includes the replacement of \nmissing hormones.\nSUGGESTED READINGS\nBuzney E , Sheu J , Buzney C , Reynolds R V.

There are no phenotypic or molecu -\nlar tools that allow a precise classification in these cases, \nand a diagnosis of pcCD30+LD is appropriate if a distinc -\ntion cannot be made. Histopathologically, many cases of LyP and cALCL can be separated easily from one another, but in some instances a precise distinction may be impos -\nsible. Thus, accurate clinicopathologic correlation should be considered the standard for precise classification of pcCD30+LD.\nStaging investigations are not necessary in patients \nwith a confirmed diagnosis of LyP, but should be carried out for those with cALCL or borderline cases. Examina -\ntion of the regional lymph nodes is paramount, as well as biopsy of suspicious lymph nodes.\nIt is particularly important to clearly separate cALCL \nfrom nodal ALCL with secondary skin involvement. In this context, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is nega -\ntive in the vast majority of cases of cALCL. It is crucial to underline that secondary skin involvement may be observed both in ALK+ and ALK\u2212 nodal ALCL, thus a negative staining for ALK is not a surrogate for stag -\ning investigations in patients with cALCL. While sec -\nondary skin manifestations of nodal ALCL are usually characterized by a bad prognosis and require aggressive treatment, cALCL is an indolent disease that should be managed by surgical excision and/or local radiotherapy.\nOther Cutaneous T-cell Lymphomas\nBesides the entities discussed above, many other T-cell \nlymphomas may arise primary in the skin (see Table 20-1).  A detailed discussion of these entities is beyond the  \nscope of this chapter. In general, it is important to re -\nmember that clinicopathologic features similar to those of advanced MF can be observed in aggressive cytotoxic natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphomas. However, the long \u201cpatch\u201d stage that precedes the onset of plaques and tu -\nmors in MF is absent in cutaneous aggressive cytotoxic NK/T-cell lymphomas, and patients present with tumor stage at first diagnosis (so-called tumors \u201cd\u2019emblee\u201d). Thus, accurate history is paramount for precise classifi -\ncation. Complete staging investigations are mandatory in cutaneous aggressive cytotoxic NK/T-cell lymphomas, with particular attention to the upper respiratory tract in cases of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal-type.\nIn some areas of the globe (particularly Japan and the \nCaribbean) a lymphoma caused by the human T lympho -\ntropic virus 1 (HTLV-1, causing adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia) may be clinically and histopathologically indis -\ntinguishable from MF, thus in endemic areas HTLV-1 testing is crucial for patients with MF-like presentation.\nSubcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma \n(SPLTCL) is a low-grade T-cell lymphoma of cytotoxic T lymphocytes with a CD3+/CD4\u2013/CD8+/TIA-1+/alfa/beta+/gamma/delta phenotype. Lesions resemble those of a panniculitis clinically (particularly lupus erythematosus panniculitis), and histopathologic diagnosis, too, may be very difficult or even impossible in biopsies of older lesions. In the past, aggressive cases with a gamma/delta phenotype were included in the group of SPTCL, but such cases are now classified as cutaneous gamma/delta T-cell lymphoma in the WHO classification. Staging investigations should be performed only in cases with a proven diagnosis of SPLTCL. Systemic corticosteroids can control the disease for long periods of time, and chemotherapy should be used only for patients with extracutaneous spread .\nAn entity termed primary cutaneous small/medium \nCD4+ T-cell lymphoma is still a provisional category in the WHO classification, as convincing data on the malig -\nnant potential of this entity are yet lacking. It seems like -\nly that publications by different authors reported under this term either reactive processes (\u201cpseudolymphoma\u201d), or clonal expansions of T helper lymphocytes of unde -\ntermined significance, or aggressive cases of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified, all of them sharing a histopathologic presentation characterized  \nby a proliferation of small/medium-sized T helper \nlympho  cytes. As a rule of thumb, patients presenting with \nsolitary lesions located on the head and neck area have an excellent prognosis, and staging investigations or  \naggressive treatment should be avoided in these cases.",

Similarly, mucocutaneous infections may \nhave significant prognostic implications for pregnant \nwomen and their offspring.\nCondylomata Acuminata\nCondylomata acuminata (genital warts) are caused by \nthe human papillomavirus (HPV), most commonly \ntypes 6 and 11. Condylomata have been reported to \ngrow more rapidly during pregnancy and may enlarge \nsuch that they interfere with vaginal delivery. Condy -\nlomata acuminata in pregnant women have been asso -\nciated with laryngeal papillomas (recurrent respiratory \npapillomatosis) in infants although the route of trans -\nmission (transplacental, perinatal, postnatal) is not com -\npletely understood. It is not clear whether Cesarean \ndelivery prevents HPV transmission to the newborn. \nCesarean delivery may, however, be indicated when the \npelvic outlet is obstructed by genital warts or when vagi -\nnal delivery would result in excessive bleeding. Ablative \nor destructive therapies for condylomata are acceptable \nin pregnancy. Topical imiquimod appears to be low risk, \nbut data are limited. The use of podophyllin, podofilox \n(podophyllotoxin), or sinecatechins is contraindicated \nduring pregnancy.\nHerpes Simplex Virus Infection\nMaternal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections asso -\nciated with fetal risks include: (1) localized primary or \nrecurrent genital HSV infection and (2) disseminated \nmucocutaneous and/or visceral HSV infection. Local -\nized maternal genital HSV infection occurs either as \nprimary or recurrent infection. Although transmission \nof HSV to the fetus may occur from either primary or \nrecurrent maternal infection, primary maternal genital \ninfection poses a much higher risk to the fetus. Neo -\nnates born to mothers with a history of recurrent geni -\ntal HSV infections but no active lesions at the time of \ndelivery rarely become infected (<1%). Women without \nsymptoms or signs of genital HSV infection can deliver \nvaginally. Prematurity, spontaneous abortion, intrauter -\nine growth retardation and neonatal herpes may occur \nin 40% of neonates born to women who contract pri -\nmary HSV infection during pregnancy. Neonatal her -\npes is often a mild illness localized to skin, eyes, and \nmouth but may progress to encephalitis (15% mortal -\nity) or disseminated disease (57% mortality). The fetus \nthat acquires HSV in the second or third trimesters may \nsustain severe neonatal morbidity and death. Maternal \ndisseminated mucocutaneous HSV infection may occur \nduring the third trimester. Sequelae from dissemination \ncan be severe and increase maternal and fetal mortality \nrates to approximately 40%. Oral acyclovir can be used \nsafely in all stages of pregnancy and during lactation. A \nsmaller body of evidence supports the use valacyclovir \nand famciclovir, both believed to pose low risk in preg -\nnant women.Leprosy\nLeprosy reactions are triggered by pregnancy and the as -\nsociated altered immunity: type 1 (reversal) reaction peaks \npostpartum and type 2 reaction (erythema nodosum lep -\nrosum) occurs throughout pregnancy and lactation; the \nlatter has been associated with \u201csilent neuritis,\u201d with \nresultant early loss of nerve function. These reactions \nshould be treated with oral corticosteroids. Thalidomide \nis contraindicated in pregnancy. Fetal risk  associated \nwith maternal leprosy includes low birth weight.

They \nare categorized as tendinous, tuberous, planar, or erup \u00ad\ntive. Cholesterol is the major lipid, although sterols and \nTGs may accumulate in significant quantities in certain \nxanthomas. Xanthomas can occur in persons of any age, \nbut are more common in those over 50. Males and fe \u00ad\nmales are equally affected. The morbidity and mortality \nof xanthomas are related primarily to associated athero \u00ad\nsclerosis and pancreatitis.\nTendinous Xanthomas\nTendinous xanthomas are produced by a diffuse infiltra \u00ad\ntion of lipid within tendons, ligaments, and occasionally \nfasciae. They appear as slowly enlarging deeply situated \nsubcutaneous nodules, with normal overlying skin that is \nfreely movable. Classically, they affect the extensor ten \u00ad\ndons of the hands, knees, elbows, and the Achilles ten \u00ad\ndons. They may be confused with rheumatoid nodules or \ngouty tophi. Trauma is thought to be a predisposing fac \u00ad\ntor, although the unique distribution of the lesions in the \nvarious forms of hyperlipoproteinemia is unexplained. \nTendinous xanthomas are usually associated with hyper \u00ad\ncholesterolemia and increased levels of LDL, and they \nmay occur in association with other cutaneous xantho \u00ad\nmas, especially xanthelasmas and tuberous xanthomas. \nRarely, however, tendinous xanthomas may occur in nor \u00ad\nmolipemic xanthomatosis, especially in cerebrotendinous \nxanthomatosis. Patients with tendinous xanthomas have \nan extremely high incidence of atherosclerotic vascular \ndisease.\nTuberous Xanthomas\nTuberous xanthomas begin as small, soft, yellow, red, or \nflesh\u00adcolored papules, and usually develop in pressure \nareas such as the extensor surfaces of the body, includ \u00ad\ning the elbows, knees, and buttocks. They are painless \nand frequently coalesce to form large globular masses  \n(Figs. 26\u00ad3 and 26\u00ad4 ). Their presence usually suggests an \nelevation of serum cholesterol and LDL, but they may also be seen with TG elevation. They can be associated \nwith familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (type III) and famil \u00ad\nial hypercholesterolemia (type IIa), and may be present \nin some of the secondary hyperlipidemias (e.g., nephrotic \nsyndrome, hypothyroidism) and in the rare condition, \nsitosterolemia, associated with impaired metabolism \nof plant\u00adderived lipids. As with tendinous xanthomas, \n patients with tuberous xanthomas also have an extremely \nhigh incidence of atherosclerotic vascular disease.\nPlanar Xanthomas\nPlanar xanthomas are by far the most commonly encoun \u00ad\ntered xanthomas. These yellow, soft, macular to barely \npalpable lesions occur in three forms: xanthelasma, xan \u00ad\nthoma striatum palmare, and diffuse plane xanthoma.\nXanthelasmas are soft, velvety, flat, yellow, polygonal \npapules that appear in the eyelid area, most commonly in \nthe medial canthus ( Fig. 26\u00ad5 ). At least 50% of patients \nwith xanthelasmas will have normal plasma lipid levels. \nIf the lipid levels are abnormal, serum cholesterol is usu \u00ad\nally elevated. This is especially true in younger patients. \nAn associated finding in many of these patients is corneal \narcus, which may also occur in the older population in the \nsetting of normal lipid levels. Some secondary hyperlipo \u00ad\nproteinemias, such as cholestasis, may also be associated \nwith xanthelasmas.\nFIGURE 26-3  n Tuberous xanthomas of the elbows.\nFIGURE 26-4  n Tuberous xanthomas of the knees.\nFIGURE 26-5  n Planar xanthomas (xanthelasmas of the eyelids).",

The historical \n exclusion of some other histiocytic disorders (i.e., granu -\nloma annulare and sarcoidosis) from the category appears \nsomewhat arbitrary.\nMost of these conditions are rare and the pathogen -\nesis is unknown. A few partial exceptions exist. A  familial \nform of Rosai\u2013Dorfman disease, caused by mutations in the SLC29A3 gene, is now generally accepted. In \n necrobiotic xanthogranuloma, there is such a strong asso -\nciation with monoclonal gammopathies that a link seems likely. Finally, there appears to be a genetic link between leukemia (acute myelomonocytic leukemia and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia) and some cases of generalized eruptive histiocytoma.\nHistologically, all of the non-LCH disorders are \ncomposed of histiocytes that stain positive for CD68 or CD163, and with just rare exceptions are negative for S100 and CD1a. Specifically, indeterminate cell histio-cytosis stains positive with CD1a and S100, and Rosai\u2013Dorfman stains positive with S100. The lack of staining with CD1a and with S100 in the non-LCH disorders are important discriminators from LCH, which clinically can mimic some of the non-LCH disorders. Although there is significant histologic overlap between the non-LCH disorders, there are subtle histologic findings often unique to the various non-LCH disorders that can assist in diagnosis.",

The patient must understand that ur -\nticaria may result from a newly developed allergy to a \nmedication or other substance to which they have been \nexposed for years. The patient may be encouraged to \nkeep a personal diary of possible exposures associated \nwith meals, work, medication, environmental exposures, \netc., during 12 to 24 hours prior to the onset of each \noutbreak of urticaria. The clinician should inquire spe -\ncifically about certain exposures typically associated with \nurticaria ( Table 10-1 ).\nA specific trigger is much more likely to be identified \nin acute urticaria than in chronic urticaria. A compre -\nhensive physical examination is important for all patients \nwith chronic urticaria. Not only might systemic signs as -\nsociated with the urticaria be revealed, but also clues as to \netiologic systemic disease might be unveiled.\nLaboratory testing should be ordered when suggest -\ned by the history and physical examination. A complete \nblood count with differential, Westergren sedimenta -\ntion rate, urinalysis, and chemistry profile might be a \nscreening approach for the patient with urticaria of un -\nknown cause that lasts for more than 1 to 2 weeks. These \ntests might provide leads for obtaining supplemental \ninformation from the history and physical examination, \nand suggest additional evaluation ( Table 10-4 ).\nA number of chronic infectious processes have been \nreported to cause urticaria, including viral infections, \nsuch as hepatitis B and C, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, and herpes \nsimplex virus; Helicobacter pylori  infections; and helmin -\nthic parasitic infections. For example, a patient with urti -\ncaria who has intermittent diarrhea and peripheral blood \neosinophilia should undergo multiple stool evaluations \nfor ova and parasites. Urticaria is associated with numer -\nous autoimmune connective tissue diseases ( Table 10-1 ). \nIt can sometimes be a presenting symptom. Serology is \nwarranted if there are any additional features to suggest a \nconcomitant autoimmune disease. Screening for thyroid-\nstimulating hormone and thyroid antibodies in a patient \nwith weight gain and other thyroid-related symptoms is \nrecommended. However, without any symptoms or his -\ntory, laboratory screening tests have a low yield. A signifi -\ncant number of urticaria patients with thyroid antibodies \nare euthyroid.

Lymphoproliferative malignancies and endo -\ncrine tumors, such as ovarian tumors, although rare, may \nalso present with urticaria.\nLastly, autologous serum skin test (ASST) and autol -\nogous plasma skin test (APST) are assays developed to \nmeasure autoantibodies, such as anti-IgE and anti-Fc \u03b5RI \nantibodies, present in a large number of chronic idio -\npathic urticaria patients. However, positive ASSTs have \nbeen seen in patients with allergic rhinitis and healthy individuals without urticaria. Moreover, patients with a \npositive ASST do not appear to respond to treatments \ndifferently compared with patients with a negative ASST. \nThus, routine performance of an ASST or APST in \nchronic urticaria patients is not recommended.\nTREATMENT\nThe treatment of acute or chronic urticaria consists of \nremoval of the cause when and if possible, and treatment \nof the signs and symptoms. Acute urticaria is, by defini -\ntion, self-limiting. An evaluation aimed at uncovering the \ncause of acute urticaria is warranted to permit avoidance \nof the offending precipitant to prevent future attacks. \nTherapy of urticaria is aimed at controlling signs and \nsymptoms ( Fig. 10-4 ).\nAs part of the treatment approach, many clinicians \nadvocate empiric trials with elimination diets, even \nif a careful history excludes the common precipitants \nlisted in Table 10-1  One approach is to use a very re -\nstrictive diet, such as rice and water, for 3 to 4 days. \nIf the patient has urticaria while eating only rice and \nwater, the urticaria is almost certainly not food re -\nlated.",

Alopecia neoplastica is a cicatricial me -\ntastasis to the scalp seen most often with breast cancer. Carcinoma en cuirasse has also been reported with breast \ncancer and describes  fibrotic metastases that resemble en -\ncasement in armor.\nOther clinical appearances of cutaneous metastases in -\nclude ulcers, described in three patients in one series with oral cavity carcinoma with direct extension to the skin, inflammatory abscesses misdiagnosed as hidradenitis sup -\npurativa, cutaneous horns or keratoacanthomas, pyogenic granuloma-like lesions, pedunculated nodules, facial lymphedema, infiltration of surgical scars, morpheaform lesions, and cyst-like nodules. In neonates, cutaneous \n metastases usually present as multiple bluish nodules, \n resembling a \u201cblueberry muffin baby.\u201dDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\nGiven the nonspecific clinical presentation of  cutaneous  \nmetastases, the differential diagnosis is broad. Any pa -\ntient with a history of internal malignancy presenting with a new nodule or cluster of nodules, nonhealing ulcer, or eruption should have a biopsy performed. For skin-colored or erythematous papules or nodules, benign growths, such as fibromas, lipomas, or cysts, may be con -\nsidered, whereas vascular lesions should be considered for lesions more erythematous to violaceous in color. When inflammatory or indurated plaques are present, they may resemble cellulitis, other infections, or panniculitides. In a neonate with bluish nodules, infections, including the TORCH (toxoplasmosis, other agents, rubella, cyto -\nmegalovirus, herpes simplex) infectious agents, hemolytic disease of the newborn, and twin\u2013twin transfusion syn -\ndrome must also be considered, along with the numerous neoplastic causes.\nHISTOPATHOLOGIC FINDINGS\nCutaneous metastases typically resemble the  primary  \nmalignancy but are often less differentiated, and \n definitive identification may be difficult. The histology \nof these tumors can broadly be classified into adenocar-cinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, undifferentiated carcinomas, and a miscellaneous category that includes malignancies of the liver, endometrium, kidney, and bladder, along with small cell carcinomas. In general, the histology of most tumors demonstrates a \u201cbottom heavy\u201d appearance, with tumor growth confined to the deep dermis and sparing the epidermis. In some cases, however, there is ulceration, pagetoid spread, or abut -\nment of the epidermis.\nImmunohistochemistry has become increasingly valu -\nable in determining the primary site of cutaneous metas -\ntases. For example, cytokeratin 7 and 20 immunostaining can be helpful in distinguishing colorectal and pulmo -\nnary adenocarcinomas. Most colonic cancers are CK7\u2013/CK20+, while most adenocarcinomas of pulmonary ori -\ngin are CK7+/CK20\u2013, as are breast cancers. Most pros -\ntate cancers are CK7\u2013/CK20\u2013. Gross cystic disease fluid protein-15 is often positive in apocrine-derived tumors, such as ductal and lobular breast carcinoma. Antithyroid transcription factor antibody can be positive in lung ad -\nenocarcinoma and small-cell lung cancer, in addition to papillary thyroid cancer. Positivity of p63 and CK5/6 can distinguish primary cutaneous adnexal neoplasms from metastatic carcinomas. Her-2 protein expression may help differentiate metastatic breast cancer from primary cutaneous appendageal neoplasms, and androgen recep-tor positivity can distinguish metastatic breast cancer from primary eccrine tumors.",

Some hair shaft disorders improve gradually \nwith age.\nEXCESSIVE HAIR\nThere are two mechanisms by which systemic disease \nmay cause increased hair growth: hypertrichosis and \nhirsutism.\nHypertrichosis\nHypertrichosis is the excessive growth of nonandrogen-\ndependent hair. Hypertrichosis may be localized or gen -\neralized, congenital or acquired. Hypertrichosis may oc -\ncur via one of two major mechanisms: the conversion of \nvellus to terminal hairs; or via changes in the hair growth \ncycle.\nMany congenital causes of hypertrichosis exist. One \nof the most striking forms is congenital hypertrichosis \nlanuginosa. This is a rare syndrome in which lanugo \nhair growth persists throughout life instead of being \nshed in the first few months of life. Patients grow ex -\ncessively long, fine hairs on all hair-bearing sites. In a \nvariant of this disorder, congenital hypertrichosis ter -\nminalis, patients continuously grow terminal hairs all \nover the body. The latter variant is almost always as -\nsociated with gingival hyperplasia. Localized patches of \nhypertrichosis can also occur congenitally, with or with -\nout an underlying nevus. These are usually benign and \nisolated except when located at the base of the spine, \nwhich may be an indication of spina bifida. Large con -\ngenital melanocytic nevi, which may place the patient at \nan increased risk for developing malignant melanoma, \nmay be hypertrichotic. Cornelia de Lange syndrome is \na congenital disorder in which patients exhibit physical \nand mental retardation, characteristic facies, and irregu -\nlar teeth as well as hypertrichotic eyelashes, extensive \nvellus hypertrichosis on the trunk, posterior neck and \nelbows, and thick and convergent eyebrows (synophrys). \nOther causes of congenital hypertrichosis are listed in \nTable 43-6 .\nAcquired localized hypertrichosis may be seen in sev -\neral settings. It can be associated with an underlying dis -\nease such as thrombophlebitis, osteomyelitis, or lichen \nsimplex chronicus. It can also occur in skin that has been \noccluded under a plaster cast. Localized hypertrichosis \nin the form of trichomegaly (enlarged eyelashes) can \nbe acquired in the setting of HIV or, rarely, systemic \nlupus erythematosus. Generalized hypertrichosis can \nbe acquired in association with acrodynia, a reaction to \nchronic mercury exposure, and in children with hypo -\nthyroidism. Juvenile dermatomyositis has been associ -\nated with hypertrichosis, most prominent on the face \nand limbs. Generalized hypertrichosis has also been \nreported in 36% of patients with bulimia nervosa and \n77% of patients with anorexia nervosa. Acquired hyper -\ntrichosis lanuginosa, also known as \u201cmalignant down,\u201d is \na well-documented cutaneous manifestation of internal \nmalignancy, most commonly cancer of the lung or co -\nlon. Drugs associated with hypertrichosis are listed in \nTable 43-7 .Diagnosis and Treatment\nWhen hypertrichosis is secondary to an underlying condi -\ntion, management of that condition will often result in its \nresolution. However, when hypertrichosis is congenital, or \nwhen it is a significant cosmetic concern, a number of treat -\nment modalities exist. Albeit temporary, several mechanical \nand chemical depilatory methods may be used. Electrolysis \ninvolves the destruction of the follicle by a direct electric \ncurrent. Thermolysis involves destruction of the follicle by \nthe heat produced by an alternating electric current. The ef -\nficacy of both of these methods is operator-dependent, but \nconsidered permanent when performed correctly. Laser hair \nremoval has gained tremendous popularity and can be very \neffective for dark, coarse hair. Unfortunately, fine, lanugo \nhairs are not an ideal target for laser hair removal given their \nlight color and do not respond to treatment. Topical eflo -\nrnithine hydrochloride, an inhibitor of ornithine decarbox -\nylase, is approved for the treatment of increased facial hair \nin women, but is used off-label by many patients.",

Subcutaneous amyloid masses (amyloidomas) have been reported. The incidence of this complication of chronic dialysis appears to be de-clining due to changes in dialysis membrane function.\nSenile and Mutant Transthyretin (TTR) \nAmyloidoses (ATTR)\nTTR, long known as prealbumin, is a large tetrameric \nmolecule which transports both retinol and thyroid T4 hormone. Amyloid protein can be derived both from the wild-type molecule (senile systemic amyloidosis) and from more than 100 known mutations (familial ATTR, mostly as familial amyloid polyneuropathy, familial amy -\nloid cardiomyopathy [FAC], and central nervous system-selective amyloidoses). In developed countries, light-chain amyloidosis is the most common form, and ATTR in wild and familial forms are next; amyloidosis due to serum protein A elevation secondary to chronic infectious or inflammatory states is very uncommon. Wild-type or senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA) usually presents as late-onset sporadic cardiomyopathy, which may affect as many \nas 15% of men >80  years of age, and may present by age  \n60 years in some. Familial syndromes of amyloidosis due  \nto mutation of TTR typically present much earlier, at 20 \nto 30  years of age for some of the polyneuropathy forms.\nFamilial Syndromes of Systemic Amyloidosis\nMost familial syndromes of amyloidosis are now known \nto result from mutations in transthyretin and comprise roughly 10% of systemic amyloidosis in developed coun-tries. Inheritable autoinflammatory syndromes may result in AA-type amyloidosis. Familial Mediterranean fever, inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, results in an AA fibril type of systemic amyloidosis that is secondary to the frequent inflammatory episodes characteristic of this disease. Patients with the Muckle\u2013Wells syndrome, a fa -\nmilial disorder characterized by repeated febrile episodes, a painful urticarial eruption, and progressive deafness, de -\nvelop an amyloid nephropathy due to AA fibril deposition. The remaining familial amyloidosis syndromes that may cause skin lesions are rare. Gelsolin (an actin-modulating protein) is now known to be the fibril source in heredi -\ntary gelsolin amyloidosis (AGel amyloidosis). Cutis laxa is a principal clinical manifestation of this disease, along with skin fragility and intracutaneous bleeding. In Iceland there is a hereditary cerebral hemorrhagic disease second -\nary to the deposition of amyloid fibrils derived from cys -\ntatin C, a proteinase inhibitor. In 12 of 12 patients with this disorder who were tested, prominent subclinical cuta -\nneous deposition of cystatin C-derived amyloid was dem-onstrated by light microscopy of punch biopsy specimens.\nSkin-Limited Amyloidoses\nA variety of primary cutaneous amyloidoses have \nbeen described, including lichen amyloidosis; macular amyloidosis; biphasic amyloidosis; and amyloidoses of the anosacral, bullous, poikiloderma-like, and dyschro -\nmic types. These syndromes are seen uncommonly in the United States, lichen amyloidosis being seen the most frequently. Patients with lichen amyloidosis devel -\nop pruritic, hyperkeratotic, skin-colored or hyperpig -\nmented papules, particularly on the anterior lower ex -\ntremities, although other areas may be involved. Those with macular amyloidosis have pruritic, oval, grayish-brown macules that may coalesce to rippled or reticu -\nlar hyperpigmented patches on the lower extremities or back. Patients with both macular and papular lesions are sometimes classified as having biphasic amyloidosis, but macular, biphasic, and lichen amyloidoses probably rep -\nresent a continuum of the same process.",

The combination of ATTR and MGUS is increased in black patients because of an increase in the Val122I transthyretin mutation, which leads to car -\ndiomyopathy and an incidence of MGUS by age 80  years \nnearly twice that of white individuals. Incidence of amy -\nloid on subcutaneous fat aspirate is 80% to 90% in AL, perhaps 50% in AA, 67% in FAC-type ATTR, and 14% in SSA (wild-type) ATTR. Biopsy of the abdominal fat \npad to a depth and width of 1.5  cm may increase the find -\ning of amyloid deposition to roughly 75% in some types of ATTR.\nEvaluation\nThe evaluation of a patient with biopsy-proven cuta -\nneous amyloid deposition must be directed by the set -\nting. The presence or absence of clinical lesions, the site sampled (lesional or nonlesional skin, subcutaneous fat), the presence of associated systemic findings, and the specific histologic features seen on the biopsy specimen are all important in determining the most appropriate evaluation for an individual patient. For example, the presence of waxy hemorrhagic facial papules with his -\ntologic features of epidermal atrophy, significant dermal amyloid deposition, and amyloid infiltration of vessel walls is nearly diagnostic of AL-type systemic amyloi -\ndosis. In such a case, a thorough search for an associ -\nated plasma cell dyscrasia is mandatory. By contrast, the presence of skin-colored pruritic papules on the lower extremity that, when sampled, show features of papillary tip amyloid deposition, sparing of vessels, and rete ridge elongation would be sufficient for the diagnosis of lichen amyloidosis and would obviate the need to search for a systemic cause. Currently, the gold standard to establish the type of amyloid involvement involves the use of la -\nser microdissection of a tissue section, followed by mass spectrometry of the dissected material.\nhttp://e-surg.com",

Importantly, morphea does not evolve into SSc, \nand patients with morphea do not develop the specific \ninternal organ manifestations of SSc. As a general rule, \npatients with morphea tend to have more asymmetric, \ndiscontinuous skin involvement, and patients with SSc \ntend to have more symmetric, distal, and continuous skin \ninvolvement. Thus, the differential diagnosis of \u201chard \nskin\u201d can be separated into two main diagnostic catego -\nries: morphea and morphea-like conditions and systemic \nsclerosis and sclerodermoid conditions.Morphea (Localized Scleroderma)\nClinical Manifestations\nMorphea (localized scleroderma) occurs in both adults \nand children and may present as one or more edema -\ntous, indurated, or atrophic plaques. Morphea is typi -\ncally erythematous or violaceous in its active (or in -\nflammatory) phase ( Fig. 3-1 ) and ivory-colored or \nhyperpigmented in its damage (or noninflammatory) \nphase. Morphea is distinguished from SSc based on the \nabsence of sclerodactyly, Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, and \nnailfold capillary changes. The term \u201cmorphea\u201d may \nbe preferred over \u201clocalized scleroderma\u201d to empha -\nsize the distinction from SSc and its specific end-organ \ncomplications. Extracutaneous manifestations of mor -\nphea can include involvement of underlying structures \nsuch as bone and, in cases of linear morphea affect -\ning the head, the central nervous system. Arthralgias \nmay also be present (e.g., 10% of pediatric patients) \n(Fett, 2013 ). ANA (antinuclear antibody) positivity is \nobserved in 20% to 80% of patients with morphea, but \nis generally not indicative of an underlying systemic \nautoimmune connective tissue disease such as lupus \nerythematosus or SSc.\nWhile the classification of morphea subtypes has been \ncontroversial, one of the more commonly used systems \nproposed by Laxer and Zulian describes five morphea \nvariants based on clinical manifestations: circumscribed, \nlinear, generalized, pansclerotic, and mixed variants. \nCircumscribed morphea, the most common subtype in \nadults, presents with up to three individual plaques. Ac -\ntive lesions often demonstrate a characteristic indurated \nlilac rim ( Fig. 3-1 ); they may expand or burn out, becom -\ning ivory-white or hyperpigmented and softening over \nseveral years. Both superficial (more common; limited to \nthe epidermis and dermis) and deep (involving the deep \ndermis and subcutaneous tissues) variants of circum -\nscribed morphea have been described.\nLinear morphea presents as a band of sclerotic, de -\npressed skin, frequently with overlying hyperpigmenta -\ntion. Linear morphea is most common in children and \naffects the limbs, face, and/or scalp, typically as a single \nlesion ( Fig. 3-2 ). In children, linear morphea of the limbs \ncan cause focal growth arrest and limb length discrepan -\ncies due to disruption of the growth plate.

The incidence is higher (all-grade, 14.7%) in patients who receive anastrozole after treatment with tamoxifen.

As previously discussed, \nsome vasculitic lesions present simply as dependent non -\nblanching macules.\nOther forms of inflammatory hemorrhage exist. For \nexample, the lesion most characteristic of erythema mul -\ntiforme is a target lesion consisting of a central region of intense inflammation with epidermal necrosis or vesicle formation, often associated with an element of purpura. This central area is surrounded by an area of flesh-colored to slightly pale skin, representing relative ischemia, and then by a zone of erythema, thought to represent reactive hyperemia. Erythema multiforme is often idiopathic; the known causes are most frequently medications (includ -\ning \u201chealth foods,\u201d vitamins, and other nonprescription items) and herpes simplex infections, especially in recur -\nrent cases.\nBland Occlusion\nA third variant of palpable purpura is that which begins as a simple occlusion or thrombosis, usually of multiple dermal vessels, in the absence of significant early inflam-mation. Such lesions are often palpable but not erythema -\ntous, and tend to develop in a livedoid or retiform pattern. Hemorrhage occurs in a perivascular distribution during the early ischemic phase of a lesion as endothelial junc -\ntions break down. Inflammation is usually absent initially, but may ultimately develop as a response to ischemic ne -\ncrosis. Such bland occlusion occurs in a variety of clinical settings, including some types of disseminated intravas -\ncular coagulation, or with cold-induced but not immune complex-mediated cryoglobulinemia syndromes.\nHISTORY AND PHYSICAL FINDINGS\nBecause purpura has many different causes, the associated history and physical findings vary greatly. For instance, arthralgias, arthritis, fever, and visceral lesions may ac -\ncompany cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis. Monoclonal cryoglobulinemia results from benign or malignant lym-phoproliferative disease, which may have other manifes -\ntations. Hepatitis C infection is now recognized as the most common cause of what was formerly termed es -\nsential cryoglobulinemia. Syndromes of disseminated in -\ntravascular coagulation usually occur in association with sepsis, malignancy, or other serious underlying disorders. Although many clinicians now seem to use the term pur-pura fulminans to imply extensive purpuric lesions of any type, the term was originally coined to describe the find -\nings in patients whose dermatologic lesions resulted from extensive noninflammatory thrombosis, presenting clini-cally as noninflammatory retiform purpura.\nThe number and pattern of palpable purpura can be \nvery helpful in suggesting the likely etiology of cutaneous hemorrhage. Simple petechial hemorrhage from platelet problems or chronic pigmented purpura often clusters on the lower legs. Immune complex vasculitis also typically produces many lesions on the legs, increasing in number with dependency, but the presence of palpable or par -\ntially blanchable lesions favors the diagnosis of vasculitis.  The ANCA-associated vasculitides, along with microvas-cular occlusion syndromes most often presented with few and scattered lesions. Acral purpura may be cold-localized from cold occlusion syndromes, may be part of the sock\u2013glove purpura syndrome from a virus, usually parvovi -\nrus B19, or may be an early localization of disseminated  \nintravascular coagulation/purpura fulminans-related oc -\nclusion in hypotensive patients, particularly if on vaso-pressive agents.\nHISTOPATHOLOGIC FINDINGS\nBoth petechiae and ecchymoses show simple extravasa -\ntion of red blood cells into the dermis on biopsy, the dif -\nference being the total volume of extravasation. Patients with inflammatory hemorrhage may show leukocytoclas -\ntic vasculitis, characterized by the presence of at least some neutrophils in and around vessel walls, the presence of perivascular nuclear dust (representing degenerated neutrophil nuclei), and fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel wall. This is the histologic correlate of most forms of necrotizing vasculitis. Other types of inflammatory hem-orrhage, such as erythema multiforme, may have rela-tively few neutrophils in an infiltrate composed largely of mononuclear cells.",

These will not \nbe discussed further.\nSYSTEMIC MYCOSES\nFour closely related species of fungi can cause systemic \nillness in immunocompetent individuals. These are Histo -\nplasma capsulatum  (histoplasmosis), Blastomyces dermatitidis  \n(blastomycosis), Coccidioides immitis  (coccidioidomycosis), \nand Paracoccidioides brasiliensis  (paracoccidioidomycosis). \nThe diseases are sometimes collectively called endemic my -\ncoses because each was once regarded as having a restricted \ngeographic distribution. They are also classified as thermally \ndimorphic mycoses  because cultured colonies have one of two \ntemperature-dependent morphologic appearances. At room \ntemperature, which mimics their natural, outdoor sapro -\nphytic phase, cultures produce molds (extensive networks of \nhyphae that have a woolly or cottony appearance). In con -\ntrast, at body temperature, cultures form uniform, smooth \ncolonies of yeast-like organisms. In histologic sections of \ndiseased tissue (whether from skin, lung, or other organs), \none sees only yeast, sometimes forming reproductive buds, \nbut never hyphae. Sporotrichosis and Penicillium marnef -\nfei infection are also caused by thermally dimorphic fungi; \nthese conditions are discussed elsewhere in this chapter.\nPeople acquire these diseases mainly via inhalation of \nspores released by molds in nature, then lead to primary \npulmonary infections. Within human tissues, the organisms \nassume their pathogenic yeast phase, which reproduce by \nforming buds with distinctive, diagnostic characteristics. In \ntissue, C. immitis  forms distinctive spherical structures that \nproduce daughter endospores internally. In histopathologic \nspecimens, special fungal stains, such as Gomori methena -\nmine silver or periodic acid\u2013Schiff, greatly facilitate identifi -\ncation of these fungi.\nA cautionary note is that dimorphic fungi should be \ncultured and examined in facilities with special mycologic \ncapabilities. At room temperature, the molds, especially \nC. immitis , produce easily aerosolized propagules that \ncreate risk for accidental laboratory transmission.\nPrimary cutaneous involvement may occur with any \nof these diseases. It is rare and occurs after percutaneous \ninoculation of organisms.\nHISTOPLASMOSIS\nHistoplasmosis has been regarded as a disease primarily \nof the east-central United States, particularly along the \nOhio River basin. In fact, H. capsulatum  grows naturally \nin bird or bat guano and is found worldwide. A subspecies,  \nH. capsulatum  var. duboisii , causes disease in sub-Saharan \nAfrica. Most histoplasmosis cases are subclinical or present \nas mild, self-limited pneumonitis. Disseminated histoplas -\nmosis is a common opportunistic infection in patients with \nAIDS, malignancy, and other forms of immunosuppression.\nClinical Manifestations\nInhalation of spores leads to initial infection, which is \nasymptomatic in >80% of infected individuals. Many others have transient, self-resolving pneumonitis, often \nmisdiagnosed as bronchitis or atypical bacterial pneu -\nmonia. Cutaneous histoplasmosis follows hematogenous \ndissemination from a primary pulmonary focus. Cutane -\nous lesions have a variety of nonspecific morphologies, \nincluding macules, papules/plaques, pustules/abscesses, \nulcers, and purpuric infiltrates. Mucosal, especially oro -\npharyngeal, ulcers are more common than lesions on \nkeratinized skin. Erythema nodosum is a common but \nnonspecific reactive dermatosis, indicating a strong, suc -\ncessful immunologic response after primary exposure.\nDiagnosis\nHistoplasmosis is diagnosed by tissue or sputum cultures, \nserologic antibody tests, and/or urinary antigen studies. \nBiopsy specimens from skin or mucosa (along with lung, \nbone marrow, or other infected tissues) show perivascular \ninflammation with lymphocytes, plasma cells, and charac -\nteristic parasitized histiocytes that may contain abundant \nintracellular yeast, 1 to 3 \u03bcm each, which must be distin -\nguished from several similar-sized intracellular patho -\ngens, such as Leishmania .",

A recently described finding in patients \nwith Kawasaki disease is orange-brown chromonychia of \nthe fingernails, which appears between the 5th and 8th \ndays of fever onset and disappears in 7 to 10 days. In he -\nreditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler\u2013Weber\u2013Rendu \nsyndrome), a consistent nail finding is giant capillary loops \nof the proximal nail fold.

Patients with anemia \nmay have nail bed pallor and, conversely, those with poly -\ncythemia may have red nail beds.\nGastrointestinal System\nTerry nails are the most common finding reported in \npatients with cirrhosis. Patients with hepatitis B or C \nmay present with longitudinal striations, nail dystrophy, \nbrittle nails, onychorrhexis, and true leukonychia. Per -\nsistent hyperbilirubinemia may cause brown nails due to melanin deposition. Blue lunulae may occur in patients \nwith Wilson\u2019s disease and hemochromatosis. Cronkh -\nite\u2013Canada syndrome is characterized by nonfamilial \ngastrointestinal polyposis, diffuse skin hyperpigmenta -\ntion, alopecia, and nail changes.

Thyroglossal \nduct cysts can present anywhere from the tongue to the \ndiaphragm. Movement of the cyst with tongue protrusion \nis only seen if the connection to the tongue is  preserved. \nThis structure may activate later in life, and the cells then \ndifferentiate into columnar, ciliated, or squamous epithe -\nlium, or even into overt glandular tissue. Thyroglossal \nduct cysts account for 70% of the congenital cystic ab -\nnormalities of the neck. They usually present in the first \ndecade of life as a cystic midline mass containing mucoid \nmaterial. Occasionally, part of the duct will form a sinus \ntract extending to the skin surface at, or just lateral to, \nthe midline. This may present as a bullous lesion. These \nanomalies are classified according to their location with \nrespect to the hyoid bone: 65% are infrahyoid; 20% are \nsuprahyoid; and 15% are juxtahyoid. Thyroglossal duct \ncysts are usually mobile and nontender, unless compli -\ncated by infection. Dysphagia may occur with lesions be -\nneath the tongue and superior vena cava syndrome may \noccur with lesions that are retrosternal. Malignancies \ndevelop within these structures in less than 1% of cases; \n80% of such neoplasms are papillary adenocarcinomas. \nIt is essential that clinicians be certain that these cysts \nare distinguished from ectopic thyroid tissue, which may \nbe the only functioning thyroid tissue present in 75% of \nectopic thyroid patients. Ectopic tissue can be detected \nby ultrasound or radionuclide scans. Possible treatment \nmodalities include excision of a portion of the hyoid bone \nalong with the cyst (the \u201cSistrunk\u201d procedure decreases \nrecurrence rate compared to simple excision) and endo -\nscopic CO 2 laser for those lesions extending into the re -\nspiratory tract.\nCutaneous Metastases\nThyroid cancer accounts for 3.8% of new cancers and 0.3% \nof cancer deaths. Although the incidence of thyroid cancer \nhas been increasing, much of this may be attributable to \nincreased detection by ultrasound screening procedure. \nPapillary thyroid carcinoma accounts for the majority of \nthyroid malignancies in early life. It metastasizes to region -\nal lymph nodes, but only rarely distantly (including to the \nskin). By contrast, follicular carcinoma usually appears in \nmiddle-aged or elderly individuals, and distant metastases are more frequent. Anaplastic  tumors\u2014the giant or spin -\ndle cell subtypes\u2014occur almost without exception in those \nover 60 years of age, grow rapidly, and possess a propensity \nfor both nodal and distant metastases. Albeit rare, all histo -\nlogic types of thyroid cancer have been reported to metas -\ntasize to the skin. Such metastatic lesions tend to favor the \nhead and neck region, may be either solitary or multiple, \nand are generally painless. In this respect, metastases from \nthyroid neoplasms do not differ significantly from those \noriginating in other sites. Seeding of the skin has been re -\nported after percutaneous needle biopsy. Thyroid cancer \nmetastases have been reported from 2 to 10 years after the \ndiscovery of the primary tumor.

Recent data \nalso associate female androgenetic alopecia with CAD in \nwomen under the age of 55 years.\nHEMOCHROMATOSIS\nHemochromatosis is a common inherited disorder leading \nto excessive iron deposition, especially in the liver, heart, \npancreas, joints, and pituitary. Hyperpigmentation of the \nskin, particularly in photoexposed areas, is thought to be \ndue to enhanced melanin production resulting from exces -\nsive cutaneous iron deposits. The skin is involved in the \nmajority of patients, providing a diagnostic clue to this \nmultisystem condition. Advanced cardiac disease is a lead -\ning cause of death in this population. Cardiac involvement is \ninitially characterized by diastolic dysfunction and arrhyth -\nmias, and, in later stages, dilated cardiomyopathy and heart \nfailure. With early detection and therapy, cardiac involve -\nment may be preventable, and early cardiac disease revers -\nible.

An associated autoimmune disease or myelodys -\nplastic syndrome is present in roughly 30% of patients. \nSudden-onset, tender erythema and edema of the ex -\nternal ear, sparing the earlobe ( Fig. 37-2 ), is present at \ndisease onset in roughly 20%, and is the most common \nmanifestation. Inflammation subsides spontaneously over \n1 to 2 weeks, and then recurs, potentially resulting in car -\ntilage deformity and destruction. Small-vessel vasculitis, \nlivedo reticularis, and erythema nodosum may also occur, \nmore commonly in patients with associated myelodys -\nplastic syndrome. Cardiac involvement, including aortic \ninsufficiency, aortic aneurysms, valvular disease, and/or \narrhythmias occurs in approximately 30% of patients. \nGiven that heart disease may develop insidiously, routine \nechocardiograms have been suggested. The most severe \ncomplication in relapsing polychondritis is potentially \nfatal asphyxia as a result of tracheal collapse. Autoanti -\nbodies against type II collagen and matrilin-1 have been \nlinked to the disorder, but are neither sensitive nor spe -\ncific. Ear cartilage biopsy may support the diagnosis, but \nultimately, diagnosis rests on clinical findings. Therapy \nis directed at blocking the neutrophilic inflammatory  \nreaction, and systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppres -\nsive agents, colchicine, and dapsone have been used.\nEMBOLIC PHENOMENA\nEmboli may originate from many causes, including \nthrombi, infections, oxalate crystals, or crystallized para -\nproteins. Cholesterol emboli can occur due to dislodging of atheromatous plaques during angiography, causing a \nsyndrome associated with prominent livedo reticularis, \nretiform purpura, and peripheral eosinophilia.

In familial cases of neurofibromatosis, \nindirect linkage studies can be performed. Genes are \nsaid to be linked when markers close to the NF1 locus \nsegregate together during recombination. Through the \nextensive evaluation of multiple family members, analy -\nsis of the markers associated with the abnormal NF1 \ngene can be identified and used for genetic counseling. \nIn addition, in utero diagnosis studies are currently \navailable. However, genetic testing in neurofibroma -\ntosis remains problematic. The large variability in  \nphenotypic expression of neurofibromatosis does not \ncorrelate with specific genetic mutations. Positive ge -\nnetic results do not predict the presence, age of onset, \nor the severity of disease. There are two exceptions. Pa -\ntients with whole gene deletions, which occur in 4% to \n5% of patients with NF1, present with a large tumor \nburden, more severe cognitive impairment, large hands \nand feet, dysmorphic facial features, and have a higher \nlifetime risk of developing MPNSTs. A three-base-pair \nin-frame deletion in exon 17 of the NF1 gene is the sec -\nond exception. Patients with this genetic mutation have \nan absence of cutaneous neurofibromas and appear to \nhave a lower incidence of serious complications.\nNegative genetic analysis does not exclude the disease. \nAs a result the demand for prenatal testing remains lim -\nited. Genetic testing may offer benefit as a diagnostic tool \nin suspected patients who do not meet criteria. However, \nas the cost and the prognostic capabilities of these tests \nimprove, genetic testing may play a more significant role \nin the future.\nTreatment\nNeurofibromatosis is a multisystem disorder requiring \nmanagement by multiple disciplines. Current manage -\nment focuses on genetic counseling and symptomatic \ntreatment of specific complications. Patients with NF1 \nhave an estimated lifespan that is 15 years lower than \nthe general population with malignant degeneration be -\ning the major cause of early death. There is no overall \ntreatment for neurofibromatosis. Individual manifesta -\ntions and complications are treated as they arise. Regu -\nlar follow-up and surgical removal of rapidly enlarging \nlesions should be undertaken. In addition, removal of \ndisfiguring or functionally compromising lesions is \nrecommended. The removal of subcutaneous neuro-\nfibromas may result in neurologic deficit and should be \nperformed by a skilled surgeon. Various medical treat -\nments for plexiform neurofibromas are being evaluated \nin ongoing clinical trials.\nThe cosmetic, medical, behavioral, and social fea -\ntures of this disease may diminish the quality of life \nin patients with neurofibromatosis. Awareness of the various complications and methods of coping with \nthem are essential to decrease long-term morbidity \nrate.\nTUBEROUS SCLEROSIS COMPLEX \n(BOURNEVILLE\u2019S DISEASE)\nTSC (OMIM #191100 and #613254) is an autosomal \ndominant, multisystem disorder characterized by the \ndevelopment of hamartomas in multiple organ systems, \nincluding the brain, eyes, heart, lung, liver, kidneys, and \nskin. The classic triad of TSC included seizures, cogni -\ntive impairment, and angiofibromas. However, this triad \nonly occurs in 29% of patients and 6% can lack all three \nsymptoms.\nPathogenesis\nTuberous sclerosis shows no racial, ethnic, or sexual pre -\ndilection.

In androgenetic alopecia, a complex interplay \nof genetic and hormonal influences combines to result \nin changes in follicular architecture and deviations in \nthe hair growth cycle. There is shortening of the ana -\ngen phase and a reduction in the volume of the hair ma -\ntrix cells. These two forces in combination result in the \nconversion of terminal hairs into the short and fine vel -\nlus hairs characteristically seen in patterned baldness. In \naddition, whereas the telogen phase remains stable, the \nlatency between telogen and new anagen is found to in -\ncrease in androgenetic alopecia.\nThe mechanisms underlying hair miniaturization in \nadulthood have been an area of intense study. Initially, \nthe pathophysiology in men and women was thought \nto be identical. In men with androgenetic alopecia, in -\ncreased levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and 5a-  \nreductase are found in hair follicles in the frontal region \nof the scalp. Hair follicles miniaturize under the direct \ninfluence of DHT, and its blockade leads to stabilization \nand sometimes reversal of the miniaturization. Similar \nblockage of DHT in women does not consistently pro -\nduce the same results. For this reason, pattern hair loss \n(male or female) is a more accurate description of this \ndisease. Younger women (ages 20 to 40) who experience \npattern hair loss are more likely to have a strong family \nhistory of pattern baldness and are more likely to have an \nunderlying androgen excess. The term senescent alopecia \nhas been proposed to describe pattern alopecia in men \nand women that begins after age 60. This is much more \nclosely attributed to age than to hormone actions.\nThe cause of hyperandrogenism can be excessive andro -\ngen production, hereditary hypersensitivity to androgen \naction, or a combination of the two. Excessive androgen \nproduction may be associated with acne, hirsutism, and  \nirregular menstrual periods. Syndromes of androgen excess \ninclude polycystic ovarian syndrome, late-onset congenital \nadrenal hyperplasia ( Fig. 43-8 ), Cushing\u2019s syndrome, and \nthe HAIR-AN syndrome (i.e., hyperandrogenism, insulin \nresistance, and acanthosis nigricans).\nIn males, a number of epidemiologic studies have \nlinked androgenetic alopecia to increased risk for isch -\nemic heart disease, hypertension, and the metabolic syn -\ndrome. More recently, an association between prostate \ncancer and androgenetic alopecia has been proposed.\nDiagnosis and Treatment\nAndrogenetic alopecia or pattern hair loss is a clini -\ncal diagnosis made in the setting of gradual progressive \nhair thinning in a typical location on the scalp. In men, \nthe distribution is symmetric and bilateral, affecting the \nfrontotemporal and vertex scalp. In women, the crown \nis preferentially affected with preservation of the frontal \nhairline. While some variation in these patterns exists, \nthe classic findings are quantified by using the Norwood\u2013\nHamilton scale for men and the Ludwig scale for women. \nIf androgen excess is suspected, serum hormone levels should be checked. One can easily screen women for hor -\nmonal abnormalities by inquiring about cystic acne, ir -\nregular menses, infertility, galactorrhea, and virilization. \nIf none of these are present, the patient is unlikely to have \na hormonal abnormality.\nThe only Food and Drug Administration-approved \nmedication for women with androgenetic alopecia is mi -\nnoxidil. This topically applied medication acts as an arte -\nrial vasodilator and enhances DNA synthesis in follicular \nkeratinocytes. This results in thickening of the shafts of \nminiaturized hairs, although minoxidil\u2019s exact mecha -\nnism of action is not completely understood. In men, mi -\nnoxidil is an option as well as finasteride. Finasteride is an \norally administered 5 \u03b1-reductase inhibitor, which exerts \nits effect by significantly reducing scalp follicle DHT. It \nis not approved for use in women as it can lead to signifi -\ncant birth defects (genital abnormalities in a male fetus).",

Although the evaluation of a patient with purpura can occasionally be complicated, in many cases a good history and physical examination in conjunction with simple tests may be all that is required.\nPurpura is a generic term for visible hemorrhage in \nthe skin and mucous membranes. More specific terms de -\nscribe particular types of purpura, and subtyping purpura is essential for an efficient diagnosis. The term petechia \ngenerally implies an area of hemorrhage 4  mm or less in \ndiameter (Fig. 15-1). An ecchymosis is a deep reddish-blue, purplish, or blue-black macule, usually at least 1 to \n1.5 cm in its greatest dimension. As used in this chapter, \nthe terms petechiae and ecchymoses are also restricted to lesions that are macular (nonpalpable) and without a blanchable component, consistent with simple hemor -\nrhage. A contusion is a major trauma-induced lesion that may be purpuric, and frequently has trauma-related soft-tissue swelling and tenderness. The traditional term pal-pable purpura is best applied to a lesion that is partially but not completely blanchable, implying a component of early inflammation. Retiform or branching purpura is a term that describes hemorrhage, which may be inflam -\nmatory or noninflammatory, but is characterized by a distinctive shape, with branching or reticulate patterning of the whole lesion or of its edges. Noninflammatory reti -\nform purpura most characteristically is due to microvas-cular occlusive disease in the skin.\nPATHOGENESIS\nCutaneous hemorrhage may result from intravascular, vascular, and extravascular causes, and many differential diagnoses use this approach. It may be more helpful to approach the bedside diagnosis of purpura from a mor -\nphologic perspective, using the distinctive morphology of purpura to decide between three possible broad patho-genic mechanisms: simple hemorrhage, inflammatory hemorrhage (vessel-directed inflammation), or occlusive hemorrhage with minimal inflammation. This differen -\ntial applies to lesions of purpura that are primary, mean -\ning that the mechanism of the lesion is also the sole cause of the hemorrhage. Clinical judgment is needed to dis -\ntinguish primary hemorrhage from hemorrhage second -\nary to scratching lesions or associated with inflammation such as cellulitis or stasis dermatitis.\nSimple Hemorrhage\nSimple hemorrhage can be divided into findings with two separate sets of differential diagnoses: petechial or ecchy -\nmotic lesions.\nPetechial Simple Hemorrhage\nThrombocytopenia or Platelet Dysfunction. Platelet \ncounts above 50,000/mm\n3 are usually not accompanied \nby purpura unless an abnormality of platelet function \nexists or there is a separate injury. Therefore, throm -\nbocytopenia that might result in hemorrhage occurs at platelet counts of 50,000/mm\n3 or less, and typically is \nnot seen until the platelet count is 10,000/mm3 or be-\nlow. This is due largely to the role of platelets in re -\nleasing a variety of molecules necessary for endothelial cell health, including preserving the cadherin-mediated tight junctions between endothelial cells. Severe throm -\nbocytopenia results in a degradation of endothelial cell health, and an increase in vascular permeability with red cell extravasation, particularly in areas of increased hy-drostatic pressure. A variety of disorders can at times produce this degree of thrombocytopenia ( Table 15-1). \nAlthough severe thrombocytopenia may result in ecchy -\nmotic hemorrhage, usually the predominant morpholo -\ngy in any given patient is petechial. Conversely, platelet function defects may result in petechial hemorrhage and must be considered in this differential, but more often CHAPTER 15\nPurPura\nWarren W. Piette\nKEY POINTS\n \u2022  Purpura has an extended and complex differential \ndiagnosis, but can be sorted into three main \npathophysiologies: simple hemorrhage, \ninflammatory (vessel-directed) hemorrhage, and \nmicrovascular occlusion.\n \u2022  Recognition of patterns of morphology, number \nand distribution can rapidly narrow the diagnostic possibilities enabling a focused and efficient work-\nup to confirm the diagnosis.",

Hospitalization or intravenous therapy \nmay be necessary in some cases.\nWhen lesions of HSV or VZV fail to improve despite \nappropriate therapy (systemic acyclovir, famciclovir, or \nvalacyclovir), the possibility of an acyclovir-resistant \nstrain needs to be excluded, especially when patients \nhave been receiving chronic suppressive therapy with \noral acyclovir. Intravenous foscarnet (which does not \nrequire phosphorylation to interact with viral DNA \npolymerase) is the recommended treatment for acy -\nclovir-resistant strains. However, there are reports of \npatients developing foscarnet-resistant strains of HSV \nowing to mutations in the DNA polymerase gene. An \nalternative treatment is topical (1% gel), intralesional, \nor intravenous cidofovir.\nAdministration of the varicella vaccine to prevent pri -\nmary infection is also an important strategy to protect \nchildren and adults who do not have a prior history of var -\nicella. The vaccine can be given to HIV-infected patients \nwho have CD4 T-lymphocyte counts of >200 cells/ \u03bcL \ndespite the theoretical risk of live-virus vaccination in \nthis population. Some clinicians choose to offer the zos -\nter vaccine to HIV-infected persons who are >50 years \nof age and have good HIV control and CD4 counts of \n>200 cells/ \u03bcL; however, zoster vaccination should be \navoided in patients with CD4 counts of <200 cells/ \u03bcL. \n(Note that the vaccine used to prevent reactivated VZV \ndisease [Zostavax] contains 14 times the amount of virus \nas the vaccine to prevent primary infection.) If an HIV-\ninfected adult develops a postvaccination varicella-like \ncutaneous eruption a prompt evaluation should be made \nand consideration should be given to starting antiviral \ntherapy.\nInfections with two other members of the herpes \nfamily, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein\u2013Barr virus \n(EBV), are seen in HIV-infected individuals. The most \ncommon EBV-induced mucocutaneous disorder is oral \nhairy leukoplakia, which is characterized by filiform white \nplaques and papules, primarily on the lateral aspects of \nthe tongue ( Fig. 35-6 ). These lesions may have a some -\nwhat corrugated appearance, and improvement is seen in \nthe setting of HAART therapy.Although the disorder most commonly associated with \nCMV is retinitis, this herpes virus can lead to gastrointes -\ntinal (GI) ulcers and, occasionally, orogenital or perianal \nulcers as well as morbilliform eruptions. The detection \n(via specific immunohistochemical stains) of intranuclear \nCMV inclusions within dermal endothelial cells usually \nproves to be a more sensitive assay than viral cultures. \nIn mucocutaneous ulcers, CMV often \u201ccoexists\u201d with \nother viruses such as HSV or VZV, and as a result its true \npathogenicity has been questioned.\nBecause condylomata acuminata and mollusca con -\ntagiosa (MC)\u2014cutaneous viral infections due to human \npapilloma viruses (HPV) and poxvirus, respectively\u2014can \nbe sexually transmitted, HIV-infected patients are at in -\ncreased risk for both. Because of the coexistent immu -\nnosuppression, their clinical manifestations frequently \nbecome quite exaggerated; for example, the individual le -\nsions of MC often coalesce into broad-based plaques and \nmay become so large as to be referred to as \u201cgiant.\u201d As \nexpected, the condylomata involve the anogenital region, \nbut in addition to the genitals, the most common site of \ninvolvement for MC is the face ( Fig. 35-7 ). Even banal \nwarts (verruca vulgaris) or flat warts can become widely \ndistributed, as in organ transplant patients ( Fig. 35-8 ), \nand often persist despite HAART.\nIn women, infections with certain subtypes of HPV, \ne.g., 16 and 18, are associated with the development of \ncervical cancer, and this risk increases in the setting of \nHIV infection. These same HPV strains also increase \nthe risk of vulvar, penile, and anal carcinoma ( Fig. 35-9 ).",
        "89057ed9-0ffd-4b4f-a2e4-cf5f39a79037": "31 Viral Diseases 267\nClinical Manifestations\nHerpes simplex infection commonly occurs in immu -\nnocompetent persons as a recurrent painful vesicular \neruption, most commonly affecting the oral and perioral \n(anterior soft palate, lips, or gingival) or genital regions  \n(Fig. 31-5 ). Skin lesions with primary infection last 10 \nto 14 days and duration of recurrent lesions decreases \nwith each recurrence. Skin-to-skin contact, such as in \nwrestlers, may allow for transmission of a herpes simplex  \nviral infection known as herpes gladiatorum. Occupa -\ntional exposures in medical and dental personnel can \nproduce lesions on the hands or digits, referred to as her -\npetic whitlow. Recurrent eruptions are often triggered \nby exogenous factors, including local trauma or sunburn. \nThe primary infection with HSV often produces a more  \nsevere systemic reaction, including high fever, regional \nlymphadenopathy, and malaise, which is different from \nthe reactivated form of the disease. Neonatal herpes \nsimplex infection is one of the most life-threatening \nnewborn infections and is acquired by ascending infec -\ntion from an infected birth canal. Neonatal HSV infec -\ntion can manifest as mucocutaneous disease, encephalitis \nwithout cutaneous disease, or disseminated infection of \nmultiple organs, most commonly the liver and adrenals. \nRapid and severe progression of HSV infection may oc -\ncur in patients who are immunocompromised second -\nary to transplant, or who have underlying diseases such \nas leukemia ( Fig. 31-6 ) or HIV infection. A generalized \nherpetic infection of the skin may occur in persons with a  \npreexisting cutaneous disorder, such as atopic dermatitis \nor psoriasis, and is termed eczema herpeticum or Kaposi\u2019s \nvaricelliform eruption. Periocular involvement requires \nprompt ophthalmologic evaluation to rule out herpetic \nkeratoconjunctivitis as herpes keratitis is the most com -\nmon infectious cause of corneal blindness in the United \nStates. HSV is the usual infectious agent to trigger recur -\nrent erythema multiforme.\nDespite the wide variation in clinical syndromes, her -\npetic lesions share the appearance of grouped vesicles \non an erythematous base. Location is a critical feature \nin differentiating the various syndromes, with relatively \nwell-localized recurrent infection producing a cluster of \nvesicles in the perioral or genital areas typifying infec -\ntion with herpesvirus types 1 and 2. Lesions in immuno -\ncompromised patients may present as chronic ulcerations or hyperkeratotic or vegetative lesions resembling \nmalignancy.\nDiagnosis\nCulture of the virus has been the \u201cgold standard\u201d of diag -\nnosing HSV infection. The Tzanck preparation reveals \ncharacteristic herpesvirus-induced changes. Immunoper -\noxidase techniques using monoclonal antibodies or DNA \nhybridization techniques are rapid diagnostic methods. \nSerologic testing plays a minor role and is useful in the \ndiagnosis of primary infection, or is helpful if the result is \nnegative, making infection with this virus unlikely.\nTreatment\nIn healthy individuals, herpes simplex infection is self-\nlimited and requires only local care to prevent bacterial \nsuperinfection and to alleviate pain. Primary oral or geni -\ntal infections are often associated with significant mor -\nbidity. Acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famiciclovir reduce the \nduration of viral shedding and pain, and speed the healing \nof lesions. For patients with frequent attacks, continuous \nsuppressive therapy with acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famci-\nclovir is highly effective without evidence of cumulative \ntoxicity or resistance. Severe infections in immunocom -\npromised patients or neonates require parenteral acyclo -\nvir therapy. Intravenous foscarnet is the drug of choice \nfor HSV resistance to acyclovir in AIDS patients, but  \nintralesional or 1% topical cidofovir is also effective.\nCYTOMEGALOVIRUS\nCytomegalovirus (CMV) is another member of the her -\npesvirus group. This organism accounts for about 10% \nof mononucleosis syndrome cases, and mononucleosis is \nthe major clinical form of acquired CMV disease. Stud -\nies of antibodies to CMV indicate that infections with \nthis virus are ubiquitous. Congenital infection can occur \nby transplacental transmission of virus from an infected \nmother.",

These \nenzyme anomalies produce  accumulations of excess por -\nphyrin precursors and/or porphyrins in patterns charac -\nterizing each associated porphyria.\nHuman heme biosynthesis occurs chiefly in hepa -\ntocytes and bone marrow erythrocyte precursors. Por -\nphyrias are classified as \u201chepatic\u201d or \u201cerythropoietic\u201d  \naccording to the major tissue overproducing porphyrins \nand/or porphyrin precursors. Reduced enzyme activity \ncauses backup accumulation of its immediate substrate \nand other precursors. Irreversible spontaneous oxidation \nof nonphotoactive porphyrinogen precursors forms pho -\ntoactive porphyrin byproducts of the pathway that can be \nfound in urine, feces, plasma and/or erythrocytes ( Table \n28-2 ), and are disseminated throughout the body. Por -\nphyrin molecules avidly absorb light energy of several \nwavelengths, maximally at 400 to 410 nm (visible violet \nlight). Such energy can penetrate human epidermis and \nphotoexcite porphyrins in dermal tissues. This excitation \nenergy can then transfer to oxygen, yielding unstable, \nhighly reactive oxidizing agents in the skin. Signs and symptoms of cutaneous photosensitivity result when lipid \nperoxidation and complement activation ensue, causing \ncell membrane disintegration and release of intravascular \nand cellular contents including secondary mediators of \ninflammation.\nFour hepatic porphyrias manifest potentially fatal epi -\nsodic attacks reflecting dysfunctions of central, autonomic, \nand peripheral nervous systems. Symptoms may include \nabdominal pain, limb pain and weakness, nausea, vomiting, \nconstipation, tachycardia, hypertension, anxiety, agitation, \nconfusion, bizarre behavior, central nerve paralysis, respi -\nratory distress, seizures, or coma, which may be related to \npoorly understood effects of deranged heme synthesis on \nneurons. Attacks are often triggered by porphyrinogenic \ndrugs that induce hepatic heme synthesis. Other precipi -\ntating factors include: fasting, infections, hormonal fluctu -\nations due to menses, pregnancy or therapeutic hormones, \nor other stressors. Two acute attack porphyrias may also \nhave photocutaneous features.\nMany mutations in the genes encoding the protein \nstructures of these enzymes have been identified, with \nvarious aberrations of each gene leading to clinical \n expression of its associated porphyria. Severity of the \n encoded protein defect typically determines how much, \nif any, residual enzyme activity remains. Degrees of \n phenotypic severity may be linked to variations in mo -\nlecular genotype. Clinical expression of some porphyrias \n(Table 28-1 ) may also be influenced by environmental \nand physiologic factors.\nMost porphyrias are readily diagnosed biochemically \n(Table 28-2 ). Enzyme activity assays are commercially \navailable for only some enzymes of heme synthesis, but mu -\ntation analysis of the genes underlying any of the heritable \nporphyrias can be obtained. Several laboratories  offering \nvarious analyses are listed at the American Porphyria \nFoundation website ( www.porphyriafoundation.com ). \nOnly porphyrias with cutaneous manifestations will be \nfurther reviewed in this chapter.\nPORPHYRIA CUTANEA TARDA\nIn porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), the most common \nporphyria of adults, excess polycarboxylated porphyrins \nare produced due to reduced activity of uroporphyrino -\ngen decarboxylase (UROD) in hepatocytes.

Lesions \noften begin as small papules that enlarge, with an active \nerythematous or violaceous border. The lesions follow a \nchronic course, with variable progression and scarring. \nUnless treated, they can involve large areas of the skin \nsurface and lead to disability and disfigurement. Most le -\nsions occur in the pretibial region, and bilateral involve -\nment is seen in up to 75% of patients ( Figs. 24-5 and \n24-6 ). Less commonly, NL can occur on the feet, arms, \ntrunk, or scalp. Histologically, it is characterized by col -\nlagen degeneration surrounded by a palisading granulo -\nmatous response, thickening of blood vessel walls, and fat \ndeposition.\nEpidemiology\nLess than 2% of diabetics develop NL. More than 66% of \npatients with NL have overt DM, and approximately 20% \nhave glucose intolerance or a parent with diabetes. NL is \nobserved more often in women, and usually follows the \nonset of diabetes by a mean of 10 years, with an average \nage of onset of 22 years in type 1 diabetics, and 49 years \nin type 2 diabetics. NL can be a presenting sign and oc -\ncur concurrently with diabetes, and can even precede the \ndiagnosis of diabetes. Thus, patients with NL and normal glucose metabolism should be evaluated and followed for \nthe possibility of developing DM at a later date.\nPathogenesis\nThe specific pathogenesis of NL is unknown, although \ndiabetic microangiopathy, collagen alterations, and im -\nmune complex deposition linked to an inflammatory pro -\ncess are thought to play a role. Patients with NL have \nhigher rates of retinopathy and diabetic nephropathy, \nsuggesting that vascular injury plays a role in NL. The \nrole of glycemic control in the development of NL is  \nunclear, although optimal glycemic control is recom -\nmended in the management of NL.\nTreatment\nTreatment of NL is challenging due to widely variable re -\nsponses to therapy and the refractory nature of these le -\nsions. Spontaneous remission is observed in less than 20% \nof cases over 6 to 12 years. While tight glycemic control of \ndiabetes is recommended, it has not been specifically as -\nsociated with significant improvement in NL. Topical and \nintralesional corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors are \nused to decrease the inflammation of early active lesions. \nAgents such as pentoxiphylline and low-dose aspirin may \nhave a gradual effect on vasculopathic aspects of pathogen -\nesis. Compression therapy is used on ulcerated plaques, \nwith semipermeable membrane dressings. Phototherapy, \nparticularly PUVA, has been reported as beneficial in \nsome cases. Systemic immunomodulatory or immunosup -\npressive treatments have been helpful in rare reports, and \nrecently, there have been reports of using biologic agents \nsuch as infliximab and etanercept in severe refractory cases. \nLocal excision is usually complicated by recurrences at the \nborders.\nScleredema\nDescription\nScleredema diabeticorum is a connective tissue disorder \nassociated with type 2 diabetes characterized by diffuse, \nsymmetric, nonpitting induration of the skin with oc -\ncasional erythema ( Fig. 24-7 ). Rarely, an acute version \nof scleredema can follow streptococcal infection and an \nuncommon indistinguishable variant is associated with \nmonoclonal gammopathy. Scleredema affects the neck, \nshoulders, and back, and rarely can involve the buttocks, \nabdomen, and thighs, while acral skin is almost always \nspared. Histopathologic examination reveals marked \nthickening of the reticular dermis, and thick collagen \nbundles and mucin infiltration in the deep dermis are \nhallmark findings.

The communicating (or \nperforator) veins connect the superficial veins of the leg with \nthe deep venous system. Communicating veins are equipped \nwith one-way bicuspid valves that direct flow only into the \ndeep system. The deep veins contain valves and are either \nintramuscular or intermuscular ( Figs. 46-4 and 46-5 ).\nWhen a person is standing, the pressure in the su -\nperficial and deep venous systems is roughly equal to \nthe hydrostatic pressure in the legs (80 mm Hg). Dur -\ning the muscle contraction phase of ambulation and with \na full range of movement of the ankle, the calf muscle contraction exerts a pressure greater than 80 mm Hg in \nthe deep veins, and blood is propelled cephalad. Proper \nvalve function ensures unidirectional flow and prevents \ntransmission of high venous pressure to the superficial \ndrainage system. After deep venous emptying, calf muscle \nrelaxation, and the muscle relaxation phase of ambula -\ntion, deep venous pressure decreases to 0 to 10 mm Hg. \nValves open and allow flow from the superficial system \nto deep venous drainage. Generally, in a healthy person, \nveins empty and ambulatory venous pressure decreases \nduring exercise; this process requires intact leg veins, in -\ntact venous valves, efficient calf muscle pumps, and no \ndeep venous outflow obstruction ( Fig. 46-5 ).\nIn contrast, in persons with venous insufficiency or \ndysfunction outflow problems or reflux exist. This is  \nassociated with valve dysfunction, deep vein obstruc-\ntion, and calf muscle failure, at times caused by decreased \nankle range of motion. This results in increased sustained \nambulatory venous pressure (also known as venous hy -\npertension) during exercise, and it is most often due to \nobstruction or valvular dysfunction affecting superficial, \nperforator, or deep veins. As a result, patients develop \nedema and slow-healing wounds, most commonly on \ntheir lower legs, near their ankles.\nAlthough the causes of chronic venous hyperten -\nsion (venous insufficiency) seem reasonably well un -\nderstood, the pathophysiology of ulceration in venous",

It is benign with no internal organ in -\nvolvement; however, recurrent episodic angioedema can \nbe incapacitating. Severe attacks may be controlled by \nsystemic corticosteroids.\nDIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL \nDIAGNOSIS\nThe diagnosis of a cutaneous eruption as urticaria is \nnot usually difficult, because of the characteristic ap -\npearance and short duration of the individual lesions. \nDuring the cutaneous examination, clinicians can assess \nfor dermatographism by firmly stroking the skin on the \npatient\u2019s back. Clinicians may draw a circle with a pen \naround a new lesion and ask the patient to report later \non the duration of that individual lesion. Lesions that \nlast for more than 24 hours are urticarial, not urticaria. The presence of purpura after the wheal resolves may \naid to distinguish urticarial vasculitis from urticaria, es -\npecially if purpura is present on nonexcoriated truncal \nskin. Histopathologic examination is not required for \nroutine urticaria; however, if circled individual lesions \nlast longer than 24 hours, then these urticarial lesions \nmust be biopsied. Urticarial vasculitis is characterized \nby fibrinoid necrosis of blood vessel walls, infiltration \nwith neutrophils showing karyorrhexis, extravasation of \nred blood cells, and endothelial swelling. The histopa -\nthology of urticaria is characterized by dermal edema \nand a scant mixed perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes, \nneutrophils, and eosinophils.\nOther dermatologic diseases may have diagnostic le -\nsions that occur in association with or are superimposed \non urticarial eruptions, such as bullous pemphigoid with \nan urticarial eruption and subsequent tense blisters, and \nerythema multiforme with target-like urticarial lesions. \nInsect bites often appear urticarial but last for several \ndays, and close examination usually discloses a central \npunctum.\nThe lesions of urticaria result from infiltration of the \ndermis with fluid, giving the tissue an orange-peel ap -\npearance like that produced by intradermal injections \n(e.g., intradermal skin tests). Other dermal infiltrative \ndiseases can occasionally be confused with urticaria on \ncursory  cutaneous examination. These longstanding in -\nfiltrative conditions include granulomatous infiltrates \n(e.g., sarcoidosis, leprosy, and cutaneous tuberculosis), \nmalignant infiltrates (e.g., cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, \nand metastatic disease), fibrous processes (e.g., morphea), \nmetabolic deposits (e.g., amyloidosis and mucinosis), and \nnonurticarial inflammatory infiltrates (e.g., tumid lesions \nof lupus erythematosus, and lymphocytoma cutis).\nFIGURE 10-2  n Dermatographism.",

In im -\nmunocompetent children less than 12 years old with \nuncomplicated varicella, only supportive care is recom -\nmended.

The eruption consists of grouped \nvesicles that may appear purpuric and which later ulcerate \nand crust. The sites of predilection, in descending order, \nare thoracic, trigeminal, lumbosacral, and cervical derma -\ntomes. Involvement of the ophthalmic branch of the tri -\ngeminal nerve can cause zoster keratitis or ophthalmicus, \nwhich can lead to blindness. Vesicular lesions on the nose \n(Hutchinson\u2019s sign) portend development of zoster oph -\nthalmicus. Mild constitutional symptoms may be present. \nImmunosuppression, family history of shingles and ad -\nvanced age are risk factors for herpes zoster. In patients \nwith acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) the \neruption may be multidermatomal or disseminated and \nrecurrent. Secondary infection of cutaneous lesions may \nbe associated with scarring. Urinary retention and con -\njunctival scarring may complicate genital and periocular \ninfections, respectively.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis may be clinically obvious because of the \ncharacteristic dermatomal distribution of clustered vesicular lesions. Tzanck preparation reveals charac -\nteristic herpesvirus-induced changes. Viral culture can \nconfirm the diagnosis. Immunoperoxidase studies using \nmonoclonal antibodies and PCR detection of viral DNA \ncan be useful for diagnosis in atypical cases.\nTreatment\nHerpes zoster infection is typically self-limited in im -\nmunocompetent patients. Local care to prevent second -\nary bacterial infection, antivirals, and analgesics for pain \ncontrol are usually adequate treatment. Oral acyclovir, \nvalacyclovir, or famciclovir for 7 days has been shown \nto hasten the healing time and to reduce the acute pain \nwhen initiated within 72 hours of onset of the cutane -\nous eruption. It is unclear whether antivirals reduce the \nrisk or duration of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Pa -\ntients who present with significant pain are at greatest \nrisk for PHN. In  patients presenting with a pain score \nof \u22654 a combination of antivirals, gabapentin, and anal -\ngesics is most effective at preventing PHN. One study \ndemonstrated that if neuropathic pain is present at onset, \ntreatment with gabapentin may reduce the duration and \nseverity of PHN. Immunocompromised persons should \nbe treated with intravenous acyclovir to prevent dissemi -\nnation of the infection. Treatment of PHN is difficult. \nThe pain often decreases with time.",

Drug-induced SCLE (DI-SCLE) \nmay account for as many as one-third of patients with \nnew-onset SCLE. DI-SCLE may have a latency period \nof many weeks to months before the onset of the erup -\ntion. It may be reversible upon cessation of the trigger -\ning/exacerbating agent; however, some patients\u2019 lesions \npersist after withdrawal of the offending drug. There are \nno clinical or histopathological features that distinguish \nDI-SCLE from idiopathic cases. It is therefore a clinical \ndistinction based on the timing of administration of the \ndrug. DI-SCLE should be strongly considered in patients \nwho initially develop the disease over the age of 55 years. \nNotably, these medications may also flare skin disease in \npatients with native SCLE.\nLaboratory studies in patients with SCLE have focused \non the finding of anti-Ro (SS-A) and anti-La (SS-B) anti -\nbodies. These antibody systems are poorly represented in \nrodent tissue substrates, and thus many of these patients \nwere previously believed to have \u201cANA-negative LE.\u201d \nHowever, with the widespread use of HEp-2 (human epi -\nthelium) as a substrate, it has become apparent that many \nanti-Ro-positive patients are not ANA-negative. On a sin -\ngle determination in patients with SCLE, anti-Ro (SS-A) \nis present in 35% to 60% of cases. Repeated testing will \ndemonstrate a positive anti-Ro (SS-A) test result in 60% \nto 95% of patients with SCLE. Despite this high percent -\nage, we must keep in mind that the marker of the disease \nis not this serologic result but rather the clinical skin le -\nsions. In addition, there is some controversy regarding \nthe special relationship of anti-Ro (SS-A) with SCLE-A, \nseveral studies suggesting a stronger relationship with this \nvariant than with SCLE-P. Furthermore, anti-Ro (SS-A) \nis found in many non-SCLE situations; thus, it is neither \na sensitive nor a specific marker of SCLE.\nNEONATAL LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS\nNeonatal LE (NLE) is a syndrome in which cutaneous \ndisease is frequently present. NLE can also manifest \nas congenital heart block. In addition, transient hemo -\nlytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and hepa -\ntitis may be observed in NLE. Rarely, central nervous \nsystem involvement has been reported. For unknown \nreasons, patients with NLE uncommonly have both \ncutaneous disease and heart block. However, fami -\nlies in which one baby has had heart block can subse -\nquently have normal infants, infants with heart block, \nor infants with cutaneous disease. These neonates have photosensitive cutaneous disease (often closely resem -\nbling SCLE-A) ( Fig. 1-12 ), which begins shortly after \nbirth and spontaneously resolves over a period of 4 to \n6 months. In addition, neonates may have cytopenias, \nhepatitis, and neurologic disease. Data from a registry \nof NLE have demonstrated that the cutaneous erup -\ntion may be delayed in its onset and may not resolve for \nup to a year. The heart block is usually permanent and \ncan result in fatal outcomes.\nNLE has been linked to the presence of anti-Ro (SS-\nA), anti-La (SS-B), or, on rare occasions, anti-U 1RNP in \nthe mother and infant. However, some babies with anti-\nRo (SS-A) can be normal; thus, the presence of this anti -\nbody is not the only determining factor. The mother of a \nbaby with NLE may be asymptomatic, may have photo -\nsensitivity, or may have a connective tissue disease (e.g., \nLE, rheumatoid arthritis, or Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome). In one \nstudy, at the time of follow-up, half of those mothers who \nhad initially been asymptomatic developed a connective \ntissue disease (usually SCLE or SLE).",

Rare causes of hem -\norrhage in AL amyloidosis include depletion of factor X \nby adsorption to splenic amyloid deposits, and acquired von Willebrand syndrome, apparently secondary to the plasma cell dyscrasia. Deposition of AL amyloid is most prominent on the upper body. Stroking or pinching the skin may induce purpura in lesions in these areas, and spontaneous periorbital hemorrhage is commonly seen following Valsalva-like maneuvers (coughing or vom -\niting) or a dependently positioned head. Papules and plaques are most often yellow to skin colored, nonpru -\nritic, and frequently hemorrhagic. A waxy or translucent character in such papules is strongly suggestive of AL-type amyloid deposition. Papular deposition of amyloid is most common on the central face, eyelids, lips, tongue, buccal mucosa, postauricular areas, neck, and intertrigi-nous zones. There are reports of acquired cutis laxa, of -\nten presenting as bulbous soft distal enlargement of the fingertips, as well as pseudoxanthma elasticum changes, with altered elastin histology or function, Rarely, tissue infiltration by amyloid may present as proptosis, oph -\nthalmoplegia, periarticular soft tissue enlargement, or skeletal muscle pseudohypertrophy. Infiltration of lac-rimal or parotid glands may cause keratoconjunctivitis sicca or may mimic Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome. Deposits of AL amyloid can involve almost any internal structure, but the most characteristic associated features include peripheral neuropathy, carpal tunnel syndrome, ortho -\nstatic hypotension as a result of autonomic neuropathy, macroglossia, congestive heart failure (secondary to a  \nrestrictive cardiomyopathy), and nephrotic syndrome.\nReactive or Secondary Amyloidosis\nAcquired systemic amyloidosis of the amyloid A (AA) \nprotein fibril type is usually seen in association with a chronic inflammatory process, such as rheumatoid ar -\nthritis, leprosy, tuberculosis, syphilis, chronic osteomy -\nelitis, or chronic inflammatory bowel disease. It may also be associated with certain long-standing cutaneous disorders that may be the source of chronic inflamma -\ntion, such as decubitus ulcers, stasis ulcers, thermal burns, neglected basal cell carcinomas, hidradenitis suppurativa, dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, and reactive arthritis (previously referred to as Reiter\u2019s disease). In the United States, secondary amyloi -\ndosis is rare because chronic inflammation secondary to infection is rare. Amyloid fibrils in this setting are derived from chronically elevated serum protein A, an apolipo-protein. This protein increases with inflammation, dur-ing pregnancy, and with advancing age. Any organ may be involved, but significant hepatic, splenic, and renal infiltration is most typical. Also, unlike systemic AL fi -\nbril disease, cardiac infiltration in AA fibril disease almost never results in cardiac dysfunction.\nDeposition of amyloid in the skin is common in AA \namyloidosis and may be detected by subcutaneous fat aspiration or, less often, by blind skin biopsy. However, clinically apparent skin lesions are rare. Macular pur-pura is one of the few reported manifestations. The rar -\nity of skin lesions in this syndrome distinguishes it from AL amyloidosis. The presence of cutaneous lesions in a patient with systemic amyloidosis strongly suggests AL rather than AA amyloidosis.\nHemodialysis-Related Amyloidosis\nHemodialysis-related amyloidosis is dependent on \u03b2\n2-\nmicroglobulin. This single polypeptide chain (length 100 \namino acids) is normally present on all cell membranes, except erythrocytes and trophoblastic cells, and is the constant \u03b2-chain portion of the class I histocompatibil-\nity antigen molecule. The \u03b2\n2-microglobulin molecule is \nconstantly shed from cell membranes, and like many pro -\nteins it is freely filtered through the glomerulus and re -\nabsorbed in the proximal tubule, where it is catabolized. In renal failure this major catabolic pathway is lost, and serum levels rise. Most \u03b2\n2-microglobulin-associated amy-\nloidosis occurs in patients dialyzed for 8 or more years.",

Patients with scleredema \nare more likely to have IDDM and have multiple other \ndiabetes-related complications because of long-standing \npoor glycemic control.\nPathogenesis\nThe pathogenesis is unknown, although glycosamino -\nglycan deposition in the dermal connective tissue may \nplay a role. Thickening of the reticular dermis with de -\nposition of mucin between thickened collagen bundles \nis noted. This phenomenon may be similar to the more \nprevalent waxy induration of the skin of the extremities \nseen in IDDM.\nTreatment\nThere is no effective therapy for sclerederma and the le -\nsions are usually asymptomatic. In severely affected pa -\ntients, the combination of UVA1 or PUVA and physical \ntherapy can help improve mobility; intravenous immu -\nnoglobulin has been reported to be beneficial in severe \ncases. Strict glycemic control does not appear to affect \nthe condition, although it is recommended as a preven -\ntive measure. Physical therapy benefits patients whose \ndisease affects the shoulder girdle range of motion.\nScleroderma-like Skin Changes\nDescription\nDistinct from scleroderma, scleroderma-like skin chang -\nes consist of thickening and induration of the skin on the \ndorsum of the fingers (sclerodactyly), proximal interpha -\nlangeal joints, and may involve the metacarpophalangeal \njoints ( Fig. 24-8 ). It can extend to the forearms, arms, \nand back, and skin may have a waxy appearance. These \nchanges are bilateral, symmetric, and painless.

Unlike sclero -\nderma, this entity does not demonstrate dermal atro -\nphy, telangiectasia, edema, Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, or \npain. Scleroderma-like skin change is also distinguished \nfrom scleredema diabeticorum by the greater extent of \ninvolvement, lack of mucin deposition, and the appear -\nance in younger patients. The clinical course is progres -\nsive and leads to extensive involvement and stiffness. \nPatients with type 1 DM and severe scleroderma-like \nskin changes have a twofold increase in the occurrence \nof retinopathy and nephropathy compared to patients \nwith no or mild disease. Scleroderma-like skin changes \nare related to disease duration but not to parameters of \ndiabetic control.\nScleroderma-like skin findings are often seen in con -\njunction with diabetic hand syndrome, which consists \nof joint limitations (mainly an inability to fully extend \nthe fingers), thickened skin of the hand, and the \u201cprayer \nsign\u201d\u2014an inability to press the palms together com -\npletely, with a gap remaining between opposed palms \nand fingers ( Fig. 24-9 ). Commonly, contractures begin in \nthe fifth digit and progress radially to the other fingers. \nPalmar fascial thickening (Dupuytren\u2019s contractures) fur -\nther complicates the diabetic hand syndrome. A strong \nassociation has been found with dry palms.\nEpidemiology\nBetween 10% and 50% of diabetics manifest a degree of \nthese findings. It is more common in patients with type 1 \nDM, and males and females appear to be equally affected.\nPathogenesis\nIn biochemical studies, there has been evidence to sup -\nport that scleroderma-like syndrome with skin and joint \ninvolvement is due to nonenzymatic advanced glycosyl -\nation end products that can cause stiffening and alteration \nof turnover of collagen.\nFIGURE 24-8  n Scleroderma-like skin changes.\nFIGURE 24-7  n Scleredema.

Although much progress has been made \nin the past decade with regard to prophylaxis (antibacteri -\nal, antifungal, and antiviral), early diagnosis, and effective \ntreatment, infections remain a major cause of morbidity \nand mortality in transplant recipients.\nOrgan transplant recipients are susceptible to bacte -\nrial, viral, and fungal skin infections. Infections during the first month after transplantation are usually caused \nby nosocomial pathogens or reactivation of latent dis -\nease. Up to 6 months after transplantation, reactivation \nof latent disease or opportunistic infections predomi -\nnate. Continuation or initiation of moderate- to high-\ndose corticosteroids increases the risk of developing the \nlatter. Late infections may be caused by opportunistic \nor conventional pathogens, with the former seen more \ncommonly in those with heightened immunosuppression \nbecause of the need to treat graft rejection or active graft-\nversus-host disease (GVHD).\nAntiviral\nInfections with herpesviruses (in particular herpes sim -\nplex virus-1 [HSV-1], HSV-2, varicella-zoster virus \n[VZV], and cytomegalovirus [CMV]) were once a com -\nmon cause of morbidity and mortality during the first \nyear following transplantation. For example, in one series, \n97% of patients had one or more herpesvirus infections. \nHowever, with the routine use of prophylactic antivirals \nand the preemptive use of valganciclovir or ganciclovir \n(e.g., based on weekly blood CMV antigen or polymerase \nchain reaction [PCR] assays in allogeneic hematopoietic \nstem cell transplant patients), this situation has improved \ndramatically. Chronic human papillomavirus infections, \nhowever, still remain a significant problem in patients \nwho have received solid organ transplants, because of \ntheir need for lifelong immunosuppression.

Finally, \nsimilar to classic dermatomyositis, amyopathic dermato \u00ad\nmyositis also has an association with malignancy, mandat \u00ad\ning that these patients be followed for manifestations of \nboth interstitial lung disease and cancer.\nMYOSITIS AND MALIGNANCY\nThe issue of the relationship between dermatomyosi \u00ad\ntis\u2013polymyositis and malignancy has been clarified. The \nfrequency of malignancy in dermatomyositis has varied \nfrom 6% to 60% in various studies. This variation is \nprobably related to differing methods, and the best data \nsuggest that 18% to 32% of patients with dermatomyo \u00ad\nsitis have or will develop a malignancy. In 1992, Swedish \ninvestigators first documented the increased frequency of \nmalignancy in patients with dermatomyositis over that \nin the general population. Although patients with poly \u00ad\nmyositis had a slight increase in cancer frequency, it was \nnot highly significant and could be explained by a more \naggressive cancer search creating a diagnostic suspicion \nbias. Subsequent studies from other Scandinavian coun \u00ad\ntries have demonstrated similar findings. An Australian \nstudy demonstrated a relative risk of malignancy three to \nsix times that of the general population in patients with \ndermatomyositis. Although this risk declines over time, it \nis highest in the first 3 years after diagnosis, and remains \nelevated for at least 5 years. Heightened surveillance for \nmalignancy must therefore continue for at least 3 years \nfrom the onset of the disease.\nMalignancies may occur prior to, concurrently with, \nor after the onset of dermatomyositis. In addition, the \nmyositis may follow the course of the malignancy (a para \u00ad\nneoplastic course) or follow its own course, independent \nof treatment of the malignancy. Studies demonstrating \nthe benefits of cancer treatment on the myositis and stud \u00ad\nies showing no relationship have been reported. Relapse \nof myositis and/or cutaneous manifestations of derma \u00ad\ntomyositis may indicate cancer recurrence and warrant \ncareful investigation. A wide variety of malignancies have \nbeen reported in patients with dermatomyositis. Gyne \u00ad\ncologic malignancy, in particular ovarian carcinoma, is \nclearly overrepresented, as are lung, pancreatic, colon, \nnon\u00adHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, and breast cancer. Further \u00ad\nmore, in a Southeast Asian population carcinoma of the \nnasopharynx is overrepresented.\nAlthough advanced age has been demonstrated to be a \nrisk factor for malignancy in patients with dermatomyo \u00ad\nsitis, all adult dermatomyositis patients are considered to \nbe at risk for cancer. This concept is supported by reports \nof young adults with malignancy\u00adassociated dermatomy \u00ad\nositis. Malignancy in younger age groups occurs in tis \u00ad\nsues that are more commonly affected by malignancy in \nthe absence of myopathy (e.g., a 30\u00adyear\u00adold man would \nbe more likely to harbor a testicular tumor, whereas \na 70\u00adyear\u00adold man would be more likely to have colon \ncancer). Overall, young age should not dissuade a clini \u00ad\ncian from completing a careful malignancy work\u00adup in a \npatient with adult\u00adonset dermatomyositis. Children with \njuvenile dermatomyositis are not considered to be at an increased risk of malignancy. In this group, formal can \u00ad\ncer screening is not recommended. Rather, a full physical \nexamination and review of systems are conducted at each \npatient visit.\nFinally, the issue of whether the use of immunosup \u00ad\npressive medications is associated with an increased risk \nof subsequent malignancy in patients with myositis re \u00ad\nmains controversial. In several studies there has been no \ndemonstrated increased risk of malignancy associated \nwith the immunosuppressive therapy commonly given to \ncontrol the inflammatory myopathy in dermatomyositis \nand polymyositis. On the other hand, there are several \nreports of Epstein\u2013Barr virus\u00adassociated lymphomas aris \u00ad\ning in patients with systemic rheumatic diseases, includ \u00ad\ning dermatomyositis, on immunosuppressive medications \nsuch as methotrexate.",

Slightly more than half of patients with POEMS syndrome had bone lesions, and 85% of patients with bone lesions had osteo -\nsclerotic lesions, with or without osteolytic lesions; this is in contrast to a large series of patients with myeloma in whom osteosclerotic lesions comprised only 0.5% to 3.0% of bone lesions. Also, unlike the findings in osteo -\nlytic multiple myeloma, anemia, hypercalcemia, and renal insufficiency are uncommon, and extensive bone marrow infiltration by plasma cells is rare.\nCutaneous changes are common in this disorder, and \nreported changes include diffuse hyperpigmentation (93% to 98%); peripheral edema (92%); and sometimes anasarca, hypertrichosis (78% to 81%), a poorly charac -\nterized skin thickening (77% to 85%), and digital club -\nbing (56%).

The histopathologi-cal finding of a glomeruloid angioma is highly indicative of this syndrome. That circulating levels of vascular en -\ndothelial growth factor (VEGF) are markedly increased in these patients may provide some explanation for the vascular changes in POEMS. This increase in VEGF may come from aggregating platelets overly rich in VEGF, which could provide very high local microcirculatory concentrations of VEGF.

Less often, the \ntransmission is vertical, from mother to unborn child, re -\nsulting in congenital syphilis. The causative agent is the \nspirochete Treponema pallidum . Since World War II and \nthe introduction of penicillin, there has been an overall \ndecline in the incidence of syphilis in the United States. \nHowever, a resurgence of the disease did accompany the \nHIV epidemic, and high-risk sexual behavior that put in -\ndividuals at risk for HIV infection also put them at risk \nfor contracting syphilis.\nThe clinical manifestations of syphilis vary depend -\ning on the stage it presents. Classically, syphilis is divided \ninto four stages: primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary. \nExcept for the latent phase, specific cutaneous lesions \nthat aid in the clinical diagnosis of this disease are often \npresent.\nPrimary Syphilis\nThe characteristic lesion of primary syphilis is the chan -\ncre, a painless ulcer that is usually 1 to 1.5 cm in diam -\neter. An average of 3 weeks after exposure to infectious \nlesions of another person, a chancre can appear at the site \nof penetration of the spirochetes (either via mucosa or \nabraded skin). The most common locations are the penis, \nlabia, and cervix, followed by other urogenital sites, the \nlips, oral cavity, anus, breasts, and fingers. The majority \nof patients have a single ulcer ( Fig. 35-24 A), with multi -\nple lesions seen in approximately one-quarter of patients. \nMultiple lesions are more common when coinfected \nwith HIV ( Fig. 35-24 B). The base of the chancre is often \nmoist, but not purulent, and the edges are more sharply \ndefined than in ulcers due to Haemophilus ducreyi .

The incidence is around 6\u20137 cases/106, \nwith regional variations and with a regular increase in \nrecent decades. Although adults, especially elderly, are  \nusually affected, MF represents the most common cuta -\nneous lymphoma in children and adolescents as well.\nClinically, lesions of MF can be divided morphologi -\ncally into patches, plaques, and tumors. Morphology is commonly used to classify the disease in three clinical stages according to the presence of corresponding lesions (patch, plaque, and tumor stage), with a good correlation with prognosis (this is a good \u201crule of thumb\u201d to discuss with patients and guides discussion of available treatment options, but of course a more precise staging system should be applied\u2014see below). So-called plaque and tumor stages probably should be considered together as a more aggres -\nsive phase of the disease, compared to the chronic course of patch-stage disease. Pruritus is often a prominent symptom in all stages of the disease, and may be very difficult to treat. The diagnosis of MF is based mainly on clinicopathologic correlation. Immunohistochemical and molecular analyses offer adjunctive information that should be integrated with the clinicopathologic assessment.The precise characterization of the early phases of MF \nis still a matter of debate, and terms such as \u201cparapso -\nriasis en plaques\u201d or large plaque parapsoriasis are used differently to denote either a non-neoplastic condition that may progress to MF, or an early manifestation of the disease.

Notwithstanding the discussion on the nosology of \u201cparapsoriasis en plaques,\u201d patients with early MF should not undergo extensive staging investigations (only clini-cal examination with assessment of percentage of body involvement and of superficial lymph nodes), and should be managed in a nonaggressive way.\nPlaques of MF are characterized by infiltrated, vari -\nably scaling, reddish-brown, indurated lesions. Typical patches are usually observed contiguous to plaques or at other sites of the body. Tumors in MF may be observed in the absence of other lesions, or in combination with patches and plaques.

Biopsy of \nall ulcerations that have not improved after several weeks \nof adequate treatment should be considered to identify  \nmalignancy, vasculitis, vasculopathy, or other inflamma -\ntory disorders as possible causes. This can be done by per -\nforming an incisional biopsy from the wound edge toward \nthe center of the wound, or multiple punch biopsies of \nboth wound bed and edge. Tissue should be sent to histol -\nogy with special stains, tissue culture, and immunofluores -\ncence testing if an immune-based cause is suspected.\nHistology can be especially helpful in determining \nulcers of vasculitic or vasculopathic etiologies, as well \nas infectious and malignant causes, but are less specific \nin pyoderma gangrenosum. Depending on the biopsy  \nresult, further laboratory testing assessing for underlying \nand associated disease may be warranted.\nMalignancy is identified in chronic wounds in roughly \n0.33% of cases, and squamous cell carcinoma and basal \ncell carcinoma are the most commonly cited. Squamous \ncell carcinoma arising in a chronic ulceration tends to  \nbehave much more aggressively with metastatic disease \nthan with the usual skin-derived squamous cell carcinoma.\nWound Swabs\nBacteria are present on almost all wounds, and swabs may \nshow only colonizing (not causative) microorganisms. In \nthe case of clinical suspicion of infection, a culture from \nwound swabs would help to direct antimicrobial therapy \nbut does not determine the presence or absence of infection.\nRadiographic Studies\nAlthough VLUs are unlikely to predispose to osteomyeli -\ntis, other causes of leg ulcerations can. As a rule, if bone \nis palpated at the base of a chronic ulceration, osteomy -\nelitis must be suspected. Characteristic findings of osteo -\nmyelitis can be confirmed through radiographic studies \n(X-rays), but this method is not very sensitive. Further \ninvestigations such as a bone scan, computed tomogra -\nphy scan, gallium scan, or bone biopsy may be necessary \nto confirm a diagnosis of osteomyelitis. The relative val -\nues of magnetic resonance imaging and three-phase bone \nscans have been debated, but either of these methods can \nbe used to detect osteomyelitis.\nPROGNOSIS\nAlthough it is difficult to establish prognoses for all causes \nof leg ulcers, for VLUs, two risk factors inversely cor -\nrelated with ulcer healing prognosis are wound size and \nwound duration. For example, a VLU with a wound size \n<5 cm2 and a duration <6 months is more likely to heal \nwith compression therapy than larger and more chronic \nwounds. Compliance with adequate therapy greatly af -\nfects the outcome in patients with lower extremity ulcers. \nPatient and staff education are important for achieving successful outcomes. In patients with VLUs, recurrence \nrates are high and patients should be educated on the \nimportance of preventive measures. This includes rigor -\nous use of compression stockings after complete healing \nand possible venous intervention through endovascular \nprocedures.\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF WOUND CARE\nWound care is a critical part of patient management and is \nessential to prevent unnecessary morbidity and death. Leg \nulcerations are common (up to 2% of individuals will be \naffected in their lifetime), and, as outlined above, the asso -\nciated costs of care are extremely high. Many factors can \nbe associated with delayed wound healing, including vas -\ncular insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, neurologic  defects, \nnutritional deficiencies, and local factors (e.g., exudate, \nvenous insufficiency, infection, and edema). Identification \nand correction of these factors is essential.\nThe most important aspect of wound care is recognition \nand appropriate management of underlying disease. For \nexample, arterial disease should be managed with revas -\ncularization, venous disease with compression, inflamma -\ntory conditions with immunosuppressant medications, and \ninfectious disease with appropriate antimicrobial agents. \nGeneral principles of wound care include appropriate  \ndebridement of devitalized tissue, prompt treatment of \nany supervening wound infection, maintenance of a moist \nand clean healing environment, and compression therapy \nfor leg ulcers not associated with PAD.",

Mild to moderate \neosinophil infiltration is one of the key morphological \nfeatures of the recently described IgG4-related disease \n(IgG4-RD) spectrum in which fibrosis is a major finding. \nIgG4-RD subsequently has been reported to involve any/\nmultiple organs, and many disorders of specific organs \nare now considered to be variants of IgG4-RD, including \ncertain eosinophil-associated dermatoses (e.g., granuloma \nfaciale, angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia, and \nKimura\u2019s disease). IgG4 is lowest in concentration of the four IgG subclasses and normally constitutes 3% to 6% \nof total serum IgG; its functions are not well understood \nbut seemingly bridge innate and acquired immunity.\nHISTOPATHOLOGY\nHistopathological reaction patterns with eosinophils are \nfound in cutaneous compartments throughout the depth \nof the skin from epidermis into muscle.\nEosinophils are a predominant inflammatory cell ob -\nserved by histopathology in many diverse dermatological \ndiseases and categorized into various histopathological \npatterns including those that are defined by eosinophils, \nothers that are characterized by tissue eosinophils, and \nyet others that are typically associated with tissue eosino -\nphils ( Table 9-5 ). In some of these disorders, eosinophil \nactivation with extracellular deposition of eosinophil \ngranule proteins is known (e.g., urticaria, atopic derma -\ntitis, pemphigoid, Wells syndrome), but, because immu -\nnopathological staining for eosinophil granule proteins \nis not commonly performed, the presence and extent of \neosinophil granule protein deposition and, thus, eosino -\nphil involvement may not be known. Flame figures in \neosinophilic cellulitis as a dermatopathological feature \nwith prominent deposition of eosinophil granule pro -\nteins ( Fig. 9-1 ), in particular, are found in various condi -\ntions ( Table 9-6 ). In certain other lesions, recognition of \neosinophils in the histopathology is of doubtful or lim -\nited benefit in the diagnosis, although they still may be \npart of the pathophysiology.\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\nThe differential diagnosis ( Table 9-7 ) depends on the \npatient\u2019s presentation with respect to the type and distri -\nbution of skin lesions, pattern of eosinophil infiltration \nin the skin, other apparent organ involvement, and/or \npresence and level of peripheral blood eosinophils. The \ndifferential diagnoses overlap with various cutaneous \nmanifestations and include the spectrum of eosinophil-\nassociated dermatoses.\nTREATMENT\nThe goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and im -\nprove organ function while keeping peripheral blood \neosinophils at or less than 1 to a maximum of 2 \u00d7 109/L \nand minimizing treatment side effects. Recent pub -\nlications have reviewed management of eosinophil-\nassociated diseases including HES specifically. For \nreactive eosinophilia, management of the underlying \ndisease directs therapy.

Observed changes in skin \nduring pregnancy result from alterations in pigmenta -\ntion, vasculature, connective tissue, and glands. Although \nsometimes striking, such physiologic changes have no \nimpact on maternal or fetal health.Pigmentary Changes\nHyperpigmentation\nUp to 90% of pregnant women demonstrate some de -\ngree of hyperpigmentation, which most often is localized \nand discrete. Generalized hyperpigmentation rarely oc -\ncurs in pregnancy. When observed, additional etiolo -\ngies (i.e., adrenal insufficiency, thyrotoxicosis) should be \nconsidered. Hyperpigmentation during pregnancy most \ncommonly manifests as linea nigra, a darkening of the \nlinea alba (the tendinous median line on the anterior ab -\ndominal wall spanning from the pubic symphysis to the \nxiphoid process), which appears in the first trimester of \npregnancy and is more pronounced in women with dark -\ner skin types. Physiologic hyperpigmentation also affects \nthe nipples, areolae, neck, axillae, genitalia, perineum, \nperianal skin, and medial thighs. Hyperpigmentation re -\nsolves gradually postpartum over several months.\nPigmentary demarcation lines, sharp delineations be -\ntween areas of more and less pigmented skin, occurring \nmost commonly on the lower extremities (type B Futcher \nlines), have been reported to darken or appear de novo \nduring pregnancy. Uncommon pigmentary patterns that \ncan be encountered in pregnancy include pseudoacantho -\nsis nigricans, dermal melanocytosis, and vulvar melanosis.\nMelasma (chloasma, \u201cmask of pregnancy\u201d) presents as \nsymmetric, irregular hyperpigmented patches involving \nsun-exposed areas of the cheeks and nose (malar pattern); \nthe forehead, nose, cheeks, upper cutaneous lip, and chin \n(centrofacial pattern); or the ramus of the mandible (man -\ndibular pattern). Prevalence of melasma in pregnancy \nranges from 5% to 46%, varying greatly by demographic \npopulation and geography. Risk factors for melasma in -\nclude intermediate skin phototypes (Fitzpatrick III\u2013IV), \nultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure, family history of me -\nlasma, oral contraceptive pill use, and thyroid dysfunc -\ntion, as well as number of pregnancies and age at first \npregnancy. Approximately half of women report onset of \nmelasma in the context of pregnancy or oral contracep -\ntive pill use. The pathogenesis of melasma is poorly un -\nderstood; elevated levels of estrogen, progesterone, and \nmelanocyte-stimulating hormone during pregnancy may \nplay a role.\nMelasma usually resolves with treatment within 1 year \npostpartum; spontaneous remission rates are low (6%). \nPigmentary abnormalities persist in up to 30% of pa -\ntients; risk factors include previous oral contraceptive pill \nuse and more severe melasma pigmentation.

HHV-8 is the \ninfectious cause of all the clinical variants of Kaposi\u2019s sar -\ncoma, which have similar histologic features but develop \nin distinct patient populations and clinical settings, with \ndifferent sites of involvement, rates of progression, and \nprognoses. These variants include: (1) classic Kaposi\u2019s \nsarcoma, an indolent disease that primarily affects elder -\nly men of Mediterranean, Eastern European, or Jewish \nheritage; (2)  African-endemic Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma, a locally \naggressive cutaneous disease in adults and a fulminant \nlymphadenopathic disease in children; (3) human immu -\nnodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated epidemic Kaposi\u2019s \nsarcoma, an aggressive disease most frequently affecting \nmen who have sex with men; and (4) iatrogenic Kaposi\u2019s \nsarcoma occurring in the setting of immunosuppression, \nin particular after solid organ transplantation.\nHHV-8 DNA can be detected in virtually all Kaposi\u2019s \nsarcoma lesions, regardless of clinical subtype. HHV-8 \nencodes several genes that have been shown to indepen -\ndently transform cells to a malignant phenotype in vi -\ntro; this herpesvirus is also clearly associated with body \ncavity-related B-cell lymphoma (primary effusion lym -\nphoma) and multicentric Castleman\u2019s disease. Both the \ndetection of HHV-8 DNA in peripheral blood and an -\ntibody seroconversion studies have shown that HHV-8 \ninfection precedes and is predicative of the development \nof Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma. Antibodies to HHV-8 can be found \nin 80% to 95% of all patients with Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma and \nalmost 100% of immunocompetent patients with the \ndisease, compared to approximately 1% to 5% of the \ngeneral population. The seroprevalence of HHV-8 in -\nfection parallels the incidence of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma, and \nboth the seroprevalence and the incidence are higher in \ngeographic areas such as the Mediterranean regions and \ncentral Africa, as well as in subpopulations such as HIV-\nnegative and HIV-positive men who have sex with men \n(approximately 20% and 40% HHV-8 seroprevalence, \nrespectively). Approximately 40% of men who are sero -\npositive for both HIV and HHV-8 develop Kaposi\u2019s sar -\ncoma within 10 years. HHV-8 DNA has been detected \nin both the saliva and the semen of infected individuals, \nand epidemiologic evidence suggests a sexual mode of \ntransmission.\nImmunosuppression appears to be an important \ncofactor in the pathogenesis of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma in \nHHV-8-infected individuals.

In the International Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns study, which evaluated more than 18,000 patients on hemodialysis, pruritus was associated with a 17% higher mortality risk, an effect that was no longer significant after adjustment for measures of sleep quality. This observation suggests that sleep disturbances may have an important role in the greater mortality risk associated with ESRD pruritus. The pathophysiology of ESRD pruritus is poorly understood. Current data point toward a role for the immune system, central neuropathy, and imbalance in the opioidergic system. Early hypothe -\nses of the pathogenesis of pruritus caused by renal failure related pruritus to secondary hyperparathyroidism, but other factors such as calcium and phosphate levels may have a role in itch. Subtotal parathyroidectomy was oc-casionally associated with the control of ESRD pruritus. It has been postulated that ESRD itch is associated with a proinflammatory state with elevated C reactive protein and recent data suggest that interleukin 31, a pruritic TH-2 cytokine, is elevated in ESRD itch. In concordance with this theory, immunomodulators such as ultraviolet light (UVB), thalidomide, and topical immunomodula-tors such as tacrolimus reduced pruritus. The pruritus can be so intense that excoriations lead to cutaneous nod -\nules (prurigo nodularis). Kyrle\u2019s disease and other perfo -\nrating disorders may be present as well, as either a sign of or cause of pruritus in some patients.  The most prevalent \nbody site is the back, but the arms, head, and abdomen are also commonly affected. The symptom tends to be more severe at night.\nPRURITUS OF CHOLESTASIS\nCholestatic pruritus is highly distressing. It often  begins in  \nan acral distribution but later becomes generalized. Clini -\ncians are familiar with the causes of cholestasis, including intrahepatic (e.g., hepatitis of all causes and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy), extrahepatic (e.g., bile duct \nDermatologic cause\nCBC, Cr, LFT, TFT, ESR\nHIV serology, CXRNeurologic cause Systemic cause Psychrogenic causeNon-dermatologic causeNo primary skin lesions\nor only chronically scratched lesions\npresentChronic pruritus\nPrimary skin lesions\n/H11001//H11002 chronically scratched lesions\npresent\nFIGURE 13-1  n An algorithm for the diagnosis and investigation of pruritus.

Skin \nlesions afflict \u223c50% to 80% of patients with VP (and may \nbe the only manifestation) and \u223c30% of those with HCP. \nNeurovisceral attacks may be triggered in either disorder \nby porphyrinogenic drugs, fasting, hormonal fluctuations, \ninfections, or other stressors. Mutations in the protopor -\nphyrinogen oxidase gene ( PPOX ) cause VP; mutations \nin the coproporphyrinogen oxidase ( CPOX ) gene cause \nHCP. Both disorders typically present after puberty in \nheterozygotes, but the majority of PPOX  or CPOX  mu-\ntation carriers never develop symptoms. Biallelic PPOX  \nmutations cause childhood onset of a severe phenotype \nincluding short stature, clinodactyly, mental retardation, \nseizures, and photosensitivity. Biallelic CPOX  mutations \ncause similar severe childhood HCP variants.\nDiagnosis and Evaluation\nVP is biochemically characterized by combined excess PP \ngreater than coproporphyrin (CP) in feces and CP great -\ner than uroporphyrin in urine ( Table 28-2 ). Abnormally \nhigh levels of porphobilinogen and aminolevulinic acid \nappear in urine and plasma during attacks. Plasma fluo -\nrescence emission scanning shows a pathognomonic peak \nat 626 \u00b1 1 nm. Porphyrin and porphyrin precursor levels \nin urine, plasma, and feces may normalize when VP is \nquiescent, or may remain increased at variable levels and \nrise during attacks. HCP is biochemically characterized \nby increased CP III in urine and feces as well as high uri -\nnary porphobilinogen and aminolevulinic acid during at -\ntacks. Suspected acute attacks should be rapidly assessed \nby urinary porphobilinogen screening tests, and medical \nmanagement instituted immediately if positive.\nMutation analysis for PPOX  and CPOX  genes is com -\nmercially available. Since most heterozygous carriers of \nPPOX  or CPOX  mutations remain clinically silent and \nmay also be biochemically silent, particularly in child -\nhood, confidently identifying all family members at risk \nrequires mutation analyses. Both VP and HCP may be \ncomplicated by hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatic ultra -\nsound and serum \u03b1-fetoprotein surveillance every 6 to \n12 months, beginning at age 47 to 50 years, has been rec -\nommended in both patients and mutation carriers.Treatment\nUnlike PCT, VP and HCP do not improve with antima -\nlarial therapy or phlebotomy; photoprotective  measures \nare essential when skin lesions are active. Minimizing \nthe risk of evoking an acute attack by avoiding porphy -\nrinogenic drugs, carbohydrate-restricted diets, immod -\nerate alcohol intake, and tobacco smoking is critically \nimportant for individuals with expressed disease and \nfor silent carriers. A \u201cDrug Safety Database\u201d can be \nfound at the American Porphyria Foundation website \n(www.porphyriafoundation.com/drug_database ). When \nnecessary, steroid hormone therapy should be initiated \ncautiously. Infections or other stressors should be treated \npromptly. An alert tag identifying an incapacitated wearer \nas having VP or HCP may prevent inadvertent adminis -\ntration of hazardous drugs.

All providers can make a major \ncontribution by ensuring patients are screened appropri -\nately. Screening for ILD is invaluable as disease is often \nasymptomatic until late in its course, and treatment (e.g., \nmycophenolate mofetil) has been shown to improve sur -\nvival. Basic screening for ILD includes pulmonary function \ntests (PFTs) with DLCO every 6 to 12 months. Findings \nof a low DLCO and/or a restrictive pattern should trig -\nger further workup for ILD, including a  high-resolution \nchest computed tomography (CT). In addition to PFTs, \nsome experts advocate a baseline  high-resolution chest \nCT. Similarly, PAH may be asymptomatic until late in its \ntrajectory, and early treatment may improve outcomes. \nAppropriate screening for PAH includes PFTs and cardiac \nechocardiography yearly; patients suspected to have PAH \nshould be referred to cardiology for right heart catheter -\nization for definitive diagnosis and ongoing management. \nAlthough scleroderma renal crisis is not included in the \n2013 classification criteria for SSc, it was the major cause \nof mortality prior to the advent of ACE inhibitors and re -\nmains an important complication.

JXG presents routinely with skin lesions ( Fig. 22-4), can present much less com -\nmonly with both mucous membrane lesions and systemic lesions affecting any organ, and can even lead to death in \nrare cases. JXG also has well-recognized  associations with  \ncaf\u00e9-au-lait macules, neurofibromatosis type 1 and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Therefore, a strong working knowledge of this disorder is a good starting place for un -\nderstanding the other non-LCH conditions.\nIn many of the non-LCH disorders, leukemia, \n lymphoma, or a paraproteinemia can occasionally or \nf requently occur in association with the condition.  \nThese include generalized eruptive histiocytoma, \n indeterminate cell histiocytosis, juvenile xanthogranu -\nloma, necrobiotic xanthogranuloma,  Rosai\u2013  Dorfman,  \nand hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.  Additionally,  \nsolid tumor malignancies are not uncommon in multi -\ncentric reticulohistiocytosis. The specifics are listed in Table 22-1.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nEach of the non-LCH disorders has its own differen-tial diagnosis, and these are briefly noted in Table 22-1. \nDiagnosis of these disorders requires an expert clinician with knowledge of the typical appearance and distribu-tion of lesions.\nEvaluation\nCareful consideration of the appearance of the lesion(s), the distribution of the lesions, and attention to any associated systemic findings is the first step in appropriate evaluation of patients with histiocytic dis -\norders. Although a clinical diagnosis can be strongly suspected, a skin biopsy is usually an important part of establishing a definitive diagnosis. Depending on the suspected disorder and the symptoms of the patient, various blood, serologic, bone, and urine studies may be necessary (Tables 22-2 and 22-3).\nTreatment\nFor those disorders that are generally self-limiting, often no treatment is needed unless a lesion is causing physi -\ncal impairment or is a significant cosmetic concern. For those that have associated symptomatic systemic lesions (i.e., a lesion involving the posterior pituitary causing diabetes insipidus), treatment may be required and is specific to the lesion and/or to the resulting problem (see Table 22-1). Additionally, for those patients with \nassociated hematologic pathology (i.e., a paraprotein -\nemia or lymphoproliferative disorder), clearly intensive hematologic subspecialty care directed at the particular problem will be required.\nCLASS III: MALIGNANT HISTIOCYTOSIS\nThe true malignant histiocytoses are very rare.

Cutaneous drug reactions can \nbe very challenging to diagnose. They can mimic many \nother skin diseases; this is especially evident during child -\nhood when viral exanthems are commonplace. If a patient \nis taking numerous medications, establishing causality to \na specific drug can be difficult.\nThis chapter includes a review of general principles, \nmechanisms, and clinical manifestations of cutaneous drug \neruptions. We have classified different types of drug erup -\ntions by morphology: exanthematous, urticarial, pustular, \nand bullous. Within each of these groups we have divided \nthem into simple, benign, or nonfebrile and complex or \nfebrile reactions. We also include a miscellaneous group \nto ensure a methodical review. Diagnostic maneuvers are \ndiscussed, and an algorithm is presented to enable the cli -\nnician to attain an idea about the possible responsible drug.\nThere are a number of ways to classify drug reactions. \nOur classification is a widely accepted and simplified ap -\nproach based on morphology and subdivided into simple \nand complex to take into account systemic features. Al -\nternative common methods of classification are either to \ndivide reactions into Type A (predictable, acute, related \nto mechanism of action) or Type B (idiosyncratic, unpre -\ndictable, and not related to mechanism of action), versus \nclassifying reactions based on the type of immunologic \nresponse (immediate IgE-mediated hypersensitivity re -\nactions, cytotoxic reactions, immune-complex-mediated \nreactions, and T-cell-mediated/delayed type reactions).\nEPIDEMIOLOGY OF CUTANEOUS DRUG \nREACTIONS\nCutaneous adverse drug reactions (CADRs) are a com -\nmonly reported type of adverse drug reaction (ADR) and can lead to frequent clinical visits and discontinuation of \ntherapy. Dermatologic reactions are the most common \nmanifestation of systemic drug hypersensitivity. Up to \n2% to 3% of all hospitalized patients experience either an \nurticarial or an exanthematous drug eruption. Up to 5% \nof patients who receive certain antibiotics while hospital -\nized experience either urticarial or exanthematous reac -\ntions. During hospital admission 10% to 20% of patients \nhave a drug reaction, and they represent the fifth most \ncommon cause of death in hospital.\nWhen a combination of trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxa -\nzole is given to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-\ninfected patients a hypersensitivity reaction may develop \nin as many as 50%. The risk of severe drug eruptions \nsuch as Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epi -\ndermal necrolysis (TEN) is increased in HIV-positive  \npatients and also in SLE, allo/BMT patients, and other \nimmune dysregulated/immune abnormal states . Fatal \nanaphylaxis from intramuscular penicillin and fatal ana -\nphylactoid reactions from radiocontrast each occur in \nabout 1: 50,000 exposed patients. In hospitalized chil -\ndren, cutaneous eruptions are the most common type of \ndrug reaction seen. Around 2.5% of children receiving \nmedication in the outpatient setting will experience a \ndrug eruption, and this figure rises to 12% if the drug is \nan antibiotic.\nDRUG-INDUCED SKIN INJURY\nThe International Serious Adverse Event Consortium in \ncollaboration with other stakeholders initiated the Phe -\nnotype Standardization Project. The goal was to develop \nstandardized phenotypic definitions for three types of \nADRs including cutaneous reactions caused by drugs: \n\u201cdrug-induced skin injury\u201d (DISI). While the majority of \nDISIs are mild, the more serious entities including drug-\ninduced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS), which is also \nknown as drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic \nsymptoms (DRESS ), SJS/TEN, and acute generalized \nexanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) form a more complex \nscenario within which genetics are an emerging factor .\nAPPROACH TO THE PATIENT WITH A \nSUSPECTED DRUG ERUPTION\nMaking the correct diagnosis is a vital element in the  \nassessment process of possible CADRs prior to introduc -\ning treatment or recommendations. Diagnosis can be \ndifficult because drug eruptions can closely mimic other \ndiseases (e.g., exanthematous drug reaction vs.",

For accurate diagnosis a rational approach is required. \nThis includes an initial clinical impression, forming a \ndifferential diagnosis, analysis of drug exposure (includ -\ning timing of new medications, dose adjustments or in -\ncreases, drug\u2013drug interactions, and metabolic changes \nand their impacts on drug levels, such as renal or hepatic \ninsufficiency), laboratory results, diagnostic tests, and \nutilization of the available literature. Prioritization of the \ndiagnosis includes a causality assessment.\nAn initial clinical impression is based principally on \nthe morphology of the eruption. The four main cat -\negories described, based on the primary lesion, are ex -\nanthematous, urticarial, blistering, or pustular. Systemic \nsigns (e.g., malaise, fever, hypotension, tachycardia, lymphadenopathy, synovitis, dyspnea, etc.) allow for re -\nfinement of the primary clinical impression ( Table 47-1 ). \nThese systemic signs may aid in differentiating a benign \nor simple cutaneous drug eruption from a severe or com -\nplex drug eruption ( Table 47-2 ). Establishment of the \ndiagnosis is the final step in diagnosis. Table 47-3  iden -\ntifies the target organs potentially involved in complex \nreactions.\nA careful analysis of drug exposure should ensue. \nAll medications should be included, regardless of route \nof administration, and incorporate prescription drugs, \nover-the-counter, and herbal remedies. Patients or care -\ngivers should be asked specifically about vitamins, pain \nmedications, sedatives, laxatives, oral contraceptive pills, \nand any medications that may not be on a pharmacy \nlist (e.g., infliximab, radiocontrast dye).

A dark-field microscopy examination of \na chancre\u2019s serous exudate will demonstrate the motile \ncorkscrew-shaped treponemes. However, if the lesion is \nlocated within the oral or anal cavity, then T. pallidum  spiro -\nchetes must be distinguished from the similar-appearing,  \nnonpathogenic, saprophytic treponemes that reside in \nthese areas. This requires consultation with a microbi -\nologist and the use of species-specific immunofluorescent \nstains. Two other less commonly used tests can be carried \nout on a sample from the chancre: direct fluorescent an -\ntibody testing and nucleic acid amplification tests. Direct \nfluorescent testing uses antibodies tagged with fluoresce -\nin, which attach to specific syphilis proteins, while nucleic \nacid amplification uses techniques, such as PCR, to detect \nthe presence of specific syphilis genes.\nIn addition, a skin biopsy specimen of the ulcer\u2019s \nedge may be obtained and a silver or immunoperox -\nidase staining can be performed to detect the spiro -\nchetes. Simultaneously, the biopsy specimen can be \nevaluated for other causes of ulcerations in the differ -\nential diagnosis.\nSerology Tests . Blood tests are divided into nontrepo -\nnemal and treponemal tests. Serologic assays are less \nsensitive in primary syphilis than in secondary syphi -\nlis, as the nontreponemal tests, e.g., venereal disease \nresearch laboratory and RPR tests, may be negative in \nup to 20% of patients. Nontreponemal tests are used \ninitially in screening. However, as these tests are occa -\nsionally false-positives, confirmation is required with a \ntreponemal test, such as T. pallidum  particle agglutina -\ntion (TPHA) or FTA-ABS. False-positives on the non -\ntreponemal tests can occur with some viral infections, \nsuch as varicella and measles, as well as with lymphoma, \ntuberculosis, malaria, endocarditis, connective tissue \ndisease, and pregnancy. False-negatives may occur in \nthe setting of overwhelmingly high levels of T. palli -\ndum, such as can be seen in HIV coinfection, termed \nthe prozone phenomenon, which should be assessed for \nwith serial dilutions. Treponemal antibody tests usu -\nally become positive 2 to 5 weeks after the initial in -\nfection. Serologic evaluation is quite helpful in patients \nwith secondary syphilis as the FTA-ABS are positive in \n>99% of patients.\nNeurosyphilis is diagnosed by finding high numbers of \nleukocytes (immunosorbent predominately lymphocytes)",

Onset and resolution tend to be more rapid than in erythroderma caused by other etiologies. Com -\nmon medications implicated in inducing erythroderma are sulfas, allopurinol, gold, penicillin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and barbiturates, but many others have been reported. At presentation, serious drug reactions such as drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis ( Fig. 14-3),  \nand Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermolytic necrolysis can present with erythroderma, and clinicians should have a high index of suspicion with close clini -\ncal monitoring for progression when evaluating patients with erythroderma. Patients with these more serious drug reactions will often have fever, additional labora -\ntory abnormalities, mucous membrane involvement, skin pain, or will show clinical progression to pustules or bul -\nlae with subsequent desquamation.\nMalignancy is another common cause of erythroderma. \nCutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), including myco -\nsis fungoides and S\u00e9zary syndrome, is the most common cause of malignancy-related erythroderma (Fig. 14-4). Patients with erythroderma from CTCL often have more pruritus than is seen with other types of erythroderma. Hodgkin\u2019s disease, non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, leukemia, and myeloplastic syndrome have also been reported to cause erythroderma, along with other solid-organ ma -\nlignancies including prostate, thyroid, esophageal, liver, melanoma, ovarian, rectal, and breast. Chronic, subacute erythroderma can be a clue to an underlying malignancy.\nOther systemic illnesses have also been reported to \npresent with generalized erythroderma, including der-matomyositis, hepatitis, seroconversion in HIV-positive individuals, graft-versus-host disease, and Omenn syn -\ndrome, among others.

Evidence suggests that this unusual migration pattern is not caused by a response to a common antigen, with different idiotype characteristics from patient to patient. Some studies found that sera from these patients \nproduced a mucin-stimulatory effect on fibroblasts in  vi-\ntro, and one study suggested that the abnormal protein was not the stimulatory factor. Despite the frequent (albeit not obligatory) presence of monoclonal protein in this disease, associated lymphoproliferative malignancies are rare.\nOther Disorders\nOther cutaneous diseases may have a rare, but appar -\nently real, association with monoclonal gammopathies \ndue to plasma cell dyscrasias or lymphoproliferative diseases. Such diseases include scleredema adultorum, erythema elevatum diutinum, subcorneal pustular der -\nmatosis, pyoderma gangrenosum, some forms of ac -\nquired angioedema (patients can develop a monoclonal protein with anti-C1 esterase activity, for example), and, more rarely, dermatomyositis, dermatitis herpetiformis, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma. Al -\nthough IgG paraprotein-associated disorders are usually the most common, some of these disorders (erythema  \nelevatum diutinum, subcorneal pustular dermatosis, and pyoderma gangrenosum) appear to have a strong IgA as-sociation, which is as yet unexplained. Dermatitis her -\npetiformis is frequently associated with polyclonal IgA gammopathy, but the increased incidence of malignan -\ncies in this disease is due to enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma, not myeloma. Spicule-like hyperkeratosis (follicular > nonfollicular) has been reported as a rare but distinctive cutaneous finding in patients with myeloma (Fig. 21-7), as has crystal-storing histiocytosis; the latter is also associated with lymphoproliferative disorders. Although skin involvement is rare in crystal-storing his -\ntiocytosis, the histologic findings are distinctive: macro -\nphages with thin crystalloid structures in the cytoplasm, consisting of phagocytosed crystals of immunoglobulins. Additional rarely reported associations include possible increased sensitivity to developing halogenoderma, pity -\nriasis rotunda, and linear IgA bullous dermatosis.\nTreatment\nThe therapy of these disorders is aimed largely at control -\nling the underlying disease process when present. Multiple myeloma usually responds to thalidomide, lenalidomide, or bortezomib (a proteasome inhibitor), either alone or in combination with weekly systemic corticosteroids. Autolo -\ngous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is considered \nthe standard of care for patients under the age of 60  years  \nafter they have responded to medical therapy. Treatment of POEMS syndrome in younger healthy individuals is currently by stem cell transplantation. In older or infirm patients melphalan and corticosteroids can be helpful.\nPrimary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma (for-\nmerly cutaneous plasmacytoma ) is treated with radiation, \n intralesional corticosteroids, and/or chemotherapy. Patients \nwith Schnitzler syndrome have been reported to respond to anakinra therapy. Therapy of xanthoma disseminatum is of -\nten ineffective, but cutaneous lesions may respond if system -\nic cytotoxic therapy is otherwise indicated. Individual lesions may respond to cryotherapy. The therapy of hypergamma-globulinemic purpura in the absence of a lymphoprolifera-tive disorder is largely symptomatic. Necrobiotic xantho -\ngranuloma may respond to therapy with alkylating agents such as melphalan, but the benefits must outweigh the risks, including the long-term risk of leukemogenesis. Scleromyx-edema is usually treated with corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, but frequently relapses.",

Most infections are \nasymptomatic. Classic dengue fever is characterized by \nheadache, retroorbital pain, and muscle and joint pains, \ncommonly referred to as \u201cbreak-bone fever.\u201d Symptoms \ntypically develop between 4 and 7 days after the bite of an \ninfected mosquito, after which fever can last up to 7 days. \nThis is followed by a period of marked fatigue that can \nlast for days to weeks. Hemorrhagic manifestations can \nbe life-threatening. DHF can be associated with circula -\ntory failure and shock. The World Health Organization \nhas defined four cardinal features of DHF, including in -\ncreased vascular permeability, marked thrombocytope -\nnia (\u2264100,000 cells/mm3), fever lasting 2 to 7 days, and a \nhemorrhagic tendency or spontaneous bleeding.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of dengue is primarily clinical. Laboratory \nconfirmation exists in developed countries, but is often \nnot available in developing countries. Laboratory con -\nfirmation consists of serology detection of viral RNA or \nNS1 antigens, which can aid in detecting dengue virus \ninfection in its early stages. The most frequently used se -\nrologic tests include the hemagglutination inhibition as -\nsay and IgG or IgM immunoassays.\nTreatment\nThere is no specific treatment for dengue infection. An -\nalgesics, rest, and adequate hydration are recommended \nby the CDC. There is also no specific treatment for \nDHF. If the diagnosis is made early, fluid resuscitation \nand hospitalization are recommended. Although there \nare several vaccines under development by researchers, \nthere are currently no approved vaccines for the treat -\nment of dengue.\nCHIKUNGUNYA\nThe Chikungunya virus is a single-stranded RNA virus \nof the genus Alphavirus  that manifests in humans as Chi -\nkungunya fever. It is endemic in parts of West Africa, \nand has recently come under the spotlight due to the first \nacquired case in the United States in 2014. Chikungunya \nvirus has been rapidly spreading in Asia and islands in \nthe Indian Ocean. It is transmitted as part of a lifecycle \nthat involves humans and species of Aedes  mosquitoes. \nThe major mosquito vectors are Aedes aegypti  and Aedes \nalbopictus , the same vectors involved in transmission of \ndengue virus.\nClinical Manifestations\nFollowing an incubation period of 2 to 4 days, clinical \nmanifestations include abrupt fever and malaise. Fever \ncan be as high as 40\u00b0 C. Polyarthralgia is another mani -\nfestation and most commonly is symmetrical, involving the hands, wrists, and ankles. Skin manifestations are \ncommon as well, with a macular or maculopapular rash \nbeing the most common.\nDiagnosis\nIn endemic areas, Chikungunya infection can be diag -\nnosed based on clinical findings. In uncommonly affected \nregions where laboratory facilities are available, serol -\nogy is the primary tool for diagnosis. ELISA is employed \nlooking for IgM anti-Chikungunya virus antibodies. IgG \nantibodies begin to appear about 2 weeks following the \nonset of symptoms. Viral culture and molecular tech -\nniques are used in research settings.\nTreatment\nTreatment of Chikungunya infection involves supportive \ncare, including anti-inflammatory and analgesic agents. \nThere are no vaccines approved for the prevention of \nChikungunya infection; however, vaccines in early devel -\nopment have shown promise.\nMARBURG/EBOLA\nMarburg and Ebola viruses are single-stranded RNA \nviruses in the family Filoviridae . Ebola virus has gained  \nextraordinary media attention recently due to the epidemic  \nin West Africa. Previously, Ebola and Marburg viruses \nwere referred to as \u201chemorrhagic fever viruses\u201d due to \ntheir potential to cause bleeding, shock, and coagulation \ndeficits. Ebola virus is no longer classified as a hemor -\nrhagic fever virus because only a very small percentage of \nEbola patients develop significant hemorrhage. The term \n\u201cEbola virus disease\u201d is now being used instead.\nClinical Manifestations\nMarburg and Ebola viruses result in similar clinical mani -\nfestations.

Occasionally, individuals with \nSWS also have extensive cutaneous malformations, limb \nhypertrophy, and vascular and lymphatic malformations, \nwhich are consistent with Klippel\u2013Trenaunay syndrome. \nThese children have been classified as having Klippel\u2013\nTrenaunay\u2013Weber syndrome.\nEvaluation and Treatment\nThe diagnosis of SWS can be straightforward in a  \npatient with a PWS, glaucoma, clinical evidence of cere -\nbral involvement, and neuroimaging confirmation. The \ndiagnosis becomes more challenging in an infant with \na facial PSW without neurologic symptoms. Radiologic \ncalcifications are seldom present at birth, but are in early \nchildhood. MRI with gadolinium is the preferred neu -\nroimaging technique. Newer MRI sequences are under \nstudy to increase the ability to make the early diagno -\nsis of brain involvement in some patients. SWS cannot \nbe ruled out with a normal brain MRI within the first \nfew months of life. An MRI is typically performed in  \ninfancy only if specific ocular or neurologic abnormalities \nare present. In older symptomatic children, the typical \nMRI findings include leptomeningeal enhancement,  \ndilated deep draining vessels, and a glomus malformation. \nThe CT findings of intracranial calcification are highly \ncharacteristic, showing double lines of curvilinear densi -\nties that parallel the cerebral convolutions, producing a \n\u201ctramline\u201d pattern. Electroencephalographic evidence of \nbrain involvement usually occurs in early childhood.\nThere is tremendous variation in the extent of neu -\nrological involvement and in the severity of symptoms. \nThe site and extent of brain involvement influence the \nneurological manifestations. Seizures can be difficult to \ncontrol with anticonvulsants and surgical therapy may \nbecome necessary. Visually guided lobectomy with ex -\ncision of the angiomatous cortex is a surgical approach \nin the patient with focal lesions. Hemispherectomy is \nconsidered in the patient with intractable seizures and \nunihemispheric involvement. Periodic lifelong assess -\nment of visual function and eye pressure is crucial to \nrecognize and treat glaucoma before it results in loss \nof vision.",

Specific HLA genotypes have been shown to \nconfer a greater susceptibility to various drug eruptions, \ne.g., HLA B*1502 and carbamazepine-induced SJS, HLA \nB*5701, and abacavir-induced hypersensitivity syndrome. \nDefective detoxification of reactive metabolites (with an -\nticonvulsants, by epoxide hydroxylases) is thought to be \nresponsible for a familial predisposition to aromatic anti -\nconvulsants and sulfonamides hypersensitivity syndrome. \nIn drug-induced lupus the acetylator phenotype is impor -\ntant: slow acetylators have a higher risk. Key information \nsources on specific cutaneous eruptions and responsible \ndrugs are listed in Table 47-6 .\nMost drugs that induce cutaneous drug eruptions have \na molecular weight of less than 1000 Da, therefore they \nmust serve as haptens for an immunologic response. A \ncell-based or soluble carrier protein is necessary for a \ndrug of this size to become a complete antigen. In most \ninstances, drug metabolites, and not the parent drug, \ninduce the immunologic hypersensitivity. Most allergic \n(immunologic hypersensitivity) drug reactions should \ndemonstrate the following features: (1) they occur in a \nsmall percentage of patients; (2) there is a history of prior \nexposure to the drug or a chemically related compound; \nand (3) there was a latency of 1 to 2 weeks between the \ninitial exposure and the onset of the reaction and a laten -\ncy of 1 to 2 days with rechallenge. Allergic drug reactions \nare not dose-dependent. The reaction differs from the \ndrug\u2019s pharmacologic effects and from other established \nsigns of drug intolerance. The eruption should resolve \nwith dechallenge and reappear after rechallenge with the \ndrug in question.Cutaneous drug eruptions that have no specific sensiti -\nzation to a drug hapten are known as \u201cpseudoallergic\u201d or \nanaphylactoid reactions. Drugs such as opiates and radio -\ncontrast material directly degranulate mast cells without \nprior specific antigen sensitization. Aspirin and NSAIDs \nmay induce urticaria by effects on the arachidonic acid \npathway, leading to nonspecific mast cell degranulation. \nIdiosyncratic reactions can lead to either organ-specific \n(such as the skin) or generalized hypersensitivity.\nReactivation of viruses has been observed in drug reac -\ntions, especially in the drug hypersensitivity syndrome. \nWhether the reactivated virus further stimulates the  \nimmune system, leading to a more severe clinical course, \nor whether the virus is an innocent bystander that is \nreactivated by drug-induced immune stimulation, is \ncontroversial.\nThe most common mode of drug administration lead -\ning to sensitization is topical exposure. Oral exposure \nleads to specific sensitization more commonly than does \nparenteral (intramuscular or intravenous) exposure. After \nspecific sensitization has occurred, rechallenge by paren -\nteral routes is significantly more risky than by oral ad -\nministration. Topical exposure presents the least risk of \nserious reactions with rechallenge.\nCross-reactions between chemically related drug \ngroups are important to consider when assessing cutane -\nous drug reactions. Most notable are the many potential \ncross-reactions between drugs with a \u03b2-lactam nucleus, \nsuch as the original penicillins, aminopenicillins, semisyn -\nthetic penicillins, and probably cephalosporins; this holds \ntrue for certain groups of anticonvulsant medications as \nwell. After the patient is sensitized to one member of this \nbroad group of drugs, other related drugs should be con -\nsidered to have a potential for cross-reaction.

Leg \nulcers are wounds located in the area between the knee and \nankle and that is the definition we will use in this chapter.\n\t\u2022  The prevalence of leg ulceration is approximately 0.3 to \n0.6%, and constitutes a great economic burden to society.\n\t\u2022\t\tVenous\tleg\tulcerations\tare\tthe\tmost\tcommon\tcause\tof\t\nleg ulcers, followed by mixed venous/arterial disease and \narterial insufficiency.\n\t\u2022\t\tUp\tto\t10%\tof\tleg\tulcers\tare\tdue\tto\tatypical\tetiologies,\t\ninfections, metabolic disorders, neoplasms, and inflam -\nmatory processes.PREVALENCE AND ECONOMIC COST\nLeg ulcerations are a common clinical problem with con -\nsiderable morbidity, high cost to society, and often a dra -\nmatic negative impact on a patient\u2019s quality of life.\nLeg ulcerations have a point prevalence rate of 0.3 \nto 0.6% and a lifetime cumulative risk of 1.0 to 1.8%. \n Venous leg ulcerations (VLUs) are the most com -\nmon cause of leg ulcers, constituting up to 80 to 90%.  \nThe average annual incidence rate of VLUs is 2.2% in \nMedicare-aged populations and 0.5% in younger privately \ninsured patients.\nVLUs are associated with increased healthcare costs. \nRecent data indicate that patients with VLUs utilize  \nsignificantly more medical resources and have increased \nannual incremental medical costs compared with matched \npatients without VLUs. Additionally, working patients \nwith VLUs missed more days from work, resulting in \nsubstantially higher work-loss costs.\nPATHOPHYSIOLOGY\nOverview\nAlthough the differential diagnosis of leg ulcerations is \nextensive, in the Western world they are most frequent -\nly caused by venous insufficiency, arterial insufficiency, \nor a combination of these ( Table 46-1 ). In one large co -\nhort of patients with leg ulceration, 72% of lesions were \nattributed to venous insufficiency, 22% to mixed arterial \nand venous disease, and 6% to predominantly arterial \ndisease.\nAtypical wounds are those chronic wounds not sec -\nondary to these causes, but rather the result of, among \nothers, infections, metabolic disorders, neoplasms, and \ninflammatory processes. It is estimated that up to 10% \nof chronic lower-extremity ulcers are due to these less \nfrequent etiologies. Dermatologists have a particular re -\nsponsibility to recognize the less common causes due to \ntraining in the diagnosis of these conditions.\nAppropriate therapy is critically dependent on \nan accurate diagnosis of the cause of the ulceration. \nFor example, small-vessel disease associated with leg \n ulcerations may be difficult to recognize and may pres -\nent as painful pinpoint ulcerations that heal with a \nwhite  atrophic scar (livedoid vasculopathy; Fig. 46-1 ). \nAdditionally, for example, care must be taken before \nestablishing a diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum  \n(Fig. 46-2 ) because many other conditions can have sim -\nilar presentations.

Coalescing areas can become fis -\nsured, and petechia and purpura are also common. Soft tissue nodules can occur and rare presentations include ulcerative lesions and a papular form imitating molluscum contagiosum. Nail changes have also been described. The lungs, liver, spleen, and bone are commonly involved dur -\ning the disease course. Lytic bone lesions are painful and primarily affect the cranium, vertebrae, and flat bones. So-called risk organ involvement includes the marrow (hematopoietic system), liver, lungs, and spleen. The prognosis of this form of LCH is variable. In those pa -\ntients with risk organ involvement, especially in children \nless than 2  years of age, there is a high risk of mortality \nand systemic treatment is required.\nSome patients present with a chronic and progressive \nform of disease. This form most often presents during childhood. Although LCH in adults is very uncommon, a chronic progressive course is a common mode of presen -\ntation in adults. Bone lesions are very frequent in this form (at least 80%) and approximately one-third of patients de -\nvelop skin or mucous membrane lesions. LCH cells also infiltrate the posterior pituitary gland in approximately 30% of patients causing diabetes insipidus. Rarely, exoph -\nthalmos develops as a late finding. The triad of diabetes \ninsipidus, bone lesions, and exophthalmos was previously \nreferred to as Hand\u2013Schuler\u2013Christian disease. The skin lesions, favoring the scalp, upper trunk, and intertriginous areas, are initially similar to those described in the acute form, but ulcerating nodules can develop especially in the gingival and genital areas. Lesions can occur in crops, older lesions can become xanthomatous, and some may spontaneously regress leaving scars. The cranium is the most common site of bone involvement. Chronic otitis media is also common and can be a clue to the presence of cranial involvement. Although patients with this variant tend to have persistent or progressive disease, most will survive with treatment.\nEosinophilic granuloma is a localized variant of LCH \nwith a striking predilection for the bone. It most commonly occurs in older children. The most common presentation is a single, often asymptomatic granulomatous cranial  lesion,  \nthough any bone can be affected. The lung can also be in-volved, which may be confused with but likely overlaps with a separate variant of LCH, pulmonary Langerhans cell his -\ntiocytosis (PLCH). Development of PLCH has a strong association with cigarette smoking and usually occurs in young adult males, with a predilection for Caucasian men.

Vesicular lesions can also occur. The vast majority of cases are limited to the skin but, uncommonly, involvement of the liver, colon, marrow, and spleen have been described.

Indeed, there are many skin conditions that have been linked to internal malignancy in a specific and/or nonspecific manner. This chapter considers those cutaneous disorders that have been linked to internal malignancy, the precise manner in which the cutaneous disease and the neoplasm are related, and the evaluation necessary for the patient with a cutaneous sign of internal malignancy.\nCurth previously suggested criteria by which to \ngauge the potential relationship of two disorders, in this case a cutaneous finding and neoplasia ( Table 17-1).  \nThe disorders may occur concurrently or follow a par -\nallel course; there may be a specific tumor site or cell type associated with the cutaneous disease; there may be a statistical association between the two processes; or there may be a genetic association between the two disorders. In this chapter, we examine these factors to determine whether a \u201ctrue\u201d association exists for three categories of skin disease: (1) proliferative and inflam -\nmatory dermatoses; (2) hormone-secreting tumors; and (3) inherited syndromes.\nPROLIFERATIVE AND INFLAMMATORY \nDERMATOSES\nAcanthosis Nigricans\nThe characteristic clinical feature of acanthosis nigricans \n(AN) is hyperpigmented, velvety thickening of the skin on intertriginous surfaces. The eruption usually affects the axillary vault (Fig. 17-1), neck, inguinal crease, nipples, and umbilicus, but may also involve areas of trauma, such as the elbows, knees, and knuckles. Frequently, the oral mucosa has a papillomatous thickening. In rare instances, the eruption can become generalized ( Fig. 17-2). \nVerrucous or papillary lesions may accompany the typical lesions of AN. Patients may develop multiple seborrheic keratoses simultaneously.\nAN can occur in many clinical scenarios, including \nobesity and insulin resistance, and as a manifestation of a number of heritable diseases (e.g., Crouzon syndrome, congenital lipodystrophy). Once other associations have been excluded, the possibility of an underlying neo-plasm must be considered, particularly with widespread AN skin involvement. In general, patients with \u201cmalig -\nnant AN\u201d are older adults with a history of associated weight loss.\nAN most often occurs simultaneously with the under -\nlying malignancy; however, it may precede or follow a malignancy diagnosis.

Probably because of their expense, messiness, \nand the time involved in their application, they are not \nalways used as directed. Despite these limitations, topical \ncorticosteroids should be prescribed in conjunction with \nother agents. The choice of a specific agent is based on \nthe clinical lesion and the area of the body that is affected. \nThe prescribing physician must bear in mind that these \nagents can produce atrophy, which is also a sign of the \ndisease. Other topical immunomodulators, such as tacro -\nlimus ointment and pimecrolimus cream, have also been \nused with some success, particularly in ACLE. These \nagents appear to be a reasonable choice for longer-term \ntreatment of lesions on the face in particular, to avoid at -\nrophy, telangiectases, and steroid-induced acne.\nLesions that do not respond to topical agents can be \ninjected with a corticosteroid, such as triamcinolone ace -\ntonide (3 to 4 mg/mL). Hypertrophic lesions, scalp le -\nsions, palmar lesions, and recalcitrant DLE lesions are \nwell suited to therapy with intralesional corticosteroids. \nAgain, it is important to recognize that atrophy is dose-\nrelated, and that there is a fine line between effectiveness \nand this complication. Secondary infection can rarely oc -\ncur at the injection site.\nAntimalarials form a mainstay of systemic therapy of \ncutaneous LE. The mechanism of action of these agents \nis unknown, but may relate to photoprotection and/or \nto immunomodulation. The agents available include hy -\ndroxychloroquine sulfate, chloroquine phosphate, and \nquinacrine HCl (quinacrine is available, but only from a \ncompounding pharmacy). In some studies, antimalarial \nagents have been shown to be less effective in patients \nwho smoke. In addition, smoking cessation has resulted in \nimproved efficacy in individual patients. It is not fully elu -\ncidated whether smoking is associated with a worsening \nof the LE, or whether it inactivates or blocks the action \nof the antimalarial, or both. Chloroquine and hydroxy -\nchloroquine may be associated with retinopathy, whereas the major side effects of quinacrine are bone marrow sup -\npression and a reversible yellow discoloration of the skin. \nThe authors\u2019 first choice is hydroxychloroquine because, \ndespite possibly being less efficacious, it has less ocular \ntoxicity than chloroquine. Hydroxychloroquine is given \nby mouth in a dose of 200 to 400 mg/day based on ideal \nbody weight. When this regimen is less effective than de -\nsired, either quinacrine 100 mg once daily can be added, \nor the patient can be switched to chloroquine (250 to \n500 mg/day). The risk of retinopathy from chloroquine \nand hydroxychloroquine is dose-related, and regular eye \nexams should be performed in these patients. The elderly \nand those with renal insufficiency may be at higher risk. \nAntimalarials are effective for DLE, SCLE, tumid LE, \nLEP, and the arthritis, malaise, and aches associated \nwith LE, but are less effective for patients with hyper -\ntrophic DLE, palmar DLE, chilblains LE, or vasculitic \nlesions. Patients with the DLE\u2013SLE subset may not re -\nspond as well to antimalarials as those without systemic  \nmanifestations.\nThe number of patients with cutaneous LE who have \na good clinical response to antimalarials has not been sys -\ntematically studied but has been estimated to be 75% to \n90%. However, there is clearly a subset of patients who \nremain recalcitrant to the above-mentioned therapies. \nMany other systemic agents have been used for recalci -\ntrant cutaneous LE. Systemic corticosteroids are gener -\nally less effective for the cutaneous disease, despite their \ndramatic effect on systemic symptoms and signs. Doses \nrequired to maintain control of cutaneous disease typi -\ncally lead to steroid-related side effects; therefore, strong \nconsideration should be given to steroid-sparing agents.",

Most OPGs develop \nwithin the first 6 years of life and the majority of cases \nrun a benign course and do not require intervention. For \nthose whose tumors do progress, chemotherapy is the \ntreatment of choice. Malignant tumors, most commonly \nlow-grade astrocytomas, may also occur. They affect the \nbrainstem and may present with symptoms of mass effect \nsuch as cranial neuropathies and hydrocephaly. However, \nthese lesions tend to have a less aggressive course when \ncompared to pontine tumors that are not associated with \nneurofibromatosis.\nA more recent issue is the presence of high-intensity  \nsignals on T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). \nThese NF-associated bright spots (also called uniden -\ntified bright objects) are often found within the basal \nganglia, cerebellum, and brainstem in up to 70% to \n80% of patients with neurofibromatosis.

Some viruses preferentially attack the hepatocyte, \nespecially hepatitis viruses A, B, and C; however, other \nviruses are commonly associated with acute hepatitis,  \nincluding the Epstein\u2013Barr virus (infectious mononucle -\nosis), cytomegalovirus, rubella, herpes simplex, herpesvi -\nrus 6, and yellow fever viruses.\nThe hepatitis virus most frequently associated with \ndermatologic syndromes is hepatitis C virus, but hepatitis \nB virus has also been associated with some cutaneous find -\nings. The incidence of new infections with hepatitis B has \nlessened with the widespread use of immunization and the \ntesting of blood products. Hepatitis B has been associated \nwith reactive erythemas such as urticaria and vasculitis. \nIn Italy, hepatitis B infection has been linked to papular \nacrodermatitis of childhood (Gianotti\u2013Crosti syndrome).\nHepatitis C (HCV) has become the most common \ncause of infectious hepatitis. HCV is spread primarily by parenteral routes, either by overt inoculation (e.g., trans -\nfusion or infection with a contaminated needle) or by in -\ntimate personal contact, including contact between sexual \npartners, and between affected patients and healthcare \nprofessionals. Patients infected with HCV usually develop \na chronic infection, either in association with demon -\nstrable hepatic disease or in otherwise seemingly healthy \ncarriers. There are at least six serotypes of HCV and they \nvary in their association with progressive disease and its se -\nverity. In addition, the ingestion of alcohol is a significant \ncofactor that may result in more severe and more rapidly \nprogressive liver disease. Unfortunately there is no vac -\ncine available for this virus, as the immune response that \noccurs with naturally acquired infection is not protective.\nSeveral dermatological conditions have been associ -\nated with HCV infection, including a serum sickness-like \nprodrome, essential mixed cryoglobulinemia, porphyria \ncutanea tarda ( Fig. 30-9 ), livedo reticularis, necrolytic \nacral erythema ( Fig. 30-9 , B), and lichen planus.

Such metastatic lesions tend to favor the \nhead and neck region, may be either solitary or multiple, \nand are generally painless. In this respect, metastases from \nthyroid neoplasms do not differ significantly from those \noriginating in other sites. Seeding of the skin has been re -\nported after percutaneous needle biopsy. Thyroid cancer \nmetastases have been reported from 2 to 10 years after the \ndiscovery of the primary tumor. Although such lesions \nusually occur in patients with a known history of malig -\nnancy, they may be the initial presentation of a cancer. In \nthose cases where a biopsy was performed and the routine \nhistology is equivocal, immunohistochemical stains (i.e., \nthyroid transcription factor and thyroglobin for most tu -\nmors, with calcitonin, synaptophysin, chromogranin, and \nCD56 being specific for medullary carcinoma) may allow \nfor a precise diagnosis.\nDermatologic Syndromes Associated \nwith Thyroid Cancer\nMedullary carcinoma of the thyroid originates from para -\nfollicular cells (C cells); these are of neural crest origin. \nMedullary thyroid carcinoma is familial in 20% of cases, \noccurring as an autosomal dominant trait as part of mul -\ntiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome type 2a or 2b, \ncaused by mutations in the RET proto-oncogene. In this \nsetting, thyroid cancer is associated with mucosal neuromas, \npheochromocytomas, neurofibromas, diffuse lentigines, \nand caf\u00e9-au-lait macules. Cutaneous macular (or lichen) \namyloidosis can occur in association with MEN 2a, making \nit an important clinical sign. Another autosomal dominant \ndisorder that predisposes to thyroid carcinoma is Cowden\u2019s \ndisease, also known as the multiple hamartoma syndrome. \nThe syndrome shows a dominant inheritance pattern, with \na variable penetrance. Various germline mutations in the \nPTEN  gene have been found in more than 80% of patients. \nFeatures of this disease include facial trichilemmomas, oral \npapillomatosis, acral and palmar keratoses, and an increased \nrisk of developing breast carcinoma.

Occasionally, the \ncutaneous disease is the initial finding in these patients, and a parallel course may also occur. A patient presenting with cutaneous vasculitis probably does not require a specific evaluation for malignancy.\nEruptive Angiomas, Telangiectases,  \nand Seborrheic Keratoses\nReports linking the sudden appearance of angiomas or \ntelangiectases with internal malignancies have been pub -\nlished in the dermatological literature. Angiomatous le -\nsions are common in the adult population and are seen as small, cherry-colored papules. It is not clear whether a rapid onset of lesions should prompt a malignancy evalu-ation. The situation in regard to telangiectases is simi -\nlarly unclear.\nThe sudden appearance or growth of multiple sebor -\nrheic keratoses is known as the sign of Leser\u2013Tr\u00e9lat (see \nFig. 17-1). Numerous reports have linked this condition to various malignancies. Many patients also have AN, and the sign of Leser\u2013Tr\u00e9lat is similarly associated with intra-abdominal adenocarcinoma, albeit to a lesser extent than with malignant AN. Population studies have not demon -\nstrated a link between multiple seborrheic keratoses and internal malignancy. However, a patient has been de -\nscribed who had demonstrable epidermal growth factor receptors on the seborrheic keratosis, with evidence that a melanoma produced this factor. In this patient, when the melanoma was excised, the keratoses regressed. Although all the criteria for an association with malignancy are not fulfilled, it seems reasonable to carefully evaluate patients with a sudden onset or growth of multiple seborrheic kera -\ntoses, including evaluation for other epidermal features as -\nsociated with internal malignancy, such as AN and tripe palms. The work-up should include a history and physical examination, and imaging studies of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary systems.\nErythroderma\nErythroderma (exfoliative dermatitis) is a cutaneous re -\naction characterized by general erythema, edema, and scaling (see Chapter 14). The reaction may be accom -\npanied by fever, lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, and/or leukocytosis. Malignancy may be present in approxi -\nmately 10% to 15% of patients. In most instances, the malignancy is in the lymphoreticular system, but several reports of solid tumors have also been published. The course of the cutaneous disease often follows that of the tumor, and the discovery of the malignant process has often been linked to the diagnosis of the cutaneous dis -\norder. Therefore, the possibility of an underlying neo-plasm must be considered in all patients with erythro -\nderma of unknown etiology.\nFigurate Erythemas\nThere are multiple figurate erythemas, but the only one that appears to be truly related to malignancy is ery -\nthema gyratum repens. In this eruption, erythematous lesions form gyrate or serpiginous bands that rapidly spread across the cutaneous surface (Fig. 17-5), produc-ing a \u201cwood-grain\u201d appearance. Nearly all patients with erythema gyratum repens have an associated malignancy, which is often discovered concurrently. The course also frequently parallels that of the neoplasm. Although any malignancy may be associated, lung cancer is the most common, followed by breast, genitourinary (GU), and gastrointestinal (GI) tumors. The presence of erythema gyratum repens mandates an extensive internal evaluation for malignancy.\nHypertrichosis Lanuginosa (Malignant \nDown)\nHypertrichosis is the excessive growth of hair without \nsigns of virilization (Fig. 17-6). The sudden development of fine downy hair has been linked to the presence of an underlying neoplasm in all patients thus far reported. The malignancies are of varied sites and cell types, and are often discovered at the time of the diagnosis of hy -\npertrichosis lanuginosa. Glossitis has also accompanied the malignancy-associated down, but it is believed to be a manifestation of vitamin deficiency rather than a related finding. Patients with this type of hair growth who do not have another clear explanation for their condition, such \nFIGURE 17-5  n Erythema gyratum repens.

This is a change from \nthe previous notion that all patients with dermatomyositis \nwould by definition have some degree of muscle involve \u00ad\nment if physicians simply investigated sufficiently to find \nit. In the current nomenclature, clinically amyopathic \ndermatomyositis includes patients with both amyopathic \nand hypomyopathic dermatomyositis, subgroups which \ncomprise approximately 20% of the total population of \ndermatomyositis patients according to the best existing \nepidemiologic data.\nAmyopathic dermatomyositis has been recognized to \ninclude a unique subset of patients with typical cutaneous \ndisease for at least 6 months without weakness or abnormal \nmuscle enzymes or testing. By definition, these patients \nmust not have received 2 consecutive months or more of \nsystemic immunosuppressive therapy in the first 6 months \nafter skin disease onset, and must not have received medi \u00ad\ncations known to cause dermatomyositis\u00adlike skin changes, \nincluding hydroxyurea and statins. These patients can be \nreferred to as having provisional amyopathic dermatomy \u00ad\nositis until 2 years after diagnosis, at which point their dis \u00ad\nease can be called confirmed amyopathic dermatomyositis. \nAlthough it presents with cutaneous disease indistinguish \u00ad\nable from that of classic dermatomyositis, amyopathic \ndermatomyositis is a distinct entity rather than a group of \npatients in whom muscle abnormalities are not yet detect \u00ad\nable. In the largest systematic review of adult\u00adonset clini \u00ad\ncally amyopathic dermatomyositis, most patients had a \nnormal EMG, muscle biopsy, and/or muscle MRI when \nperformed.\nHypomyopathic dermatomyositis includes cutaneous \nfindings and subclinical myositis evident on laboratory \ntests, EMG, biopsy, and/or MRI, but no clinical weakness \nor muscle tenderness. Importantly, these findings do not \nreliably predict the onset of clinically significant muscle \ndisease at a later time, and should therefore not neces \u00ad\nsarily warrant more aggressive therapeutic intervention. \nSontheimer reported that no patients with hypomyo\u00ad\npathic dermatomyositis had developed clinically significant \nmuscle weakness at the time of follow\u00adup, despite an aver \u00ad\nage duration of skin disease of 5.4 years.\nCutaneous lesions and histopathology are indistin \u00ad\nguishable from those of classic dermatomyositis. Similar to \nclassic dermatomyositis, there is a female preponderance, \na peak onset in the fifth and sixth decades, and a pediatric \npopulation affected by amyopathic dermatomyositis. Labo \u00ad\nratory results in amyopathic dermatomyositis are similar to  \nthose in classic dermatomyositis except for a relative lack of \nanti\u00adJo\u00ad1 antibodies, including in patients with  pulmonary \ndisease, and an increased prevalence of antimelanoma \ndifferentiation\u00adassociated gene or MDA\u00ad5 antibodies \n(previously referred to as anti\u00adCADM\u00ad140 antibodies). \nIn an American study, there was no significant difference \nin prevalence of interstitial lung disease between patients \nwith amyopathic and classic dermatomyositis.

However, other blistering conditions may resemble TEN, including drug-induced linear IgA bullous dermatosis, paraneoplastic pemphigus, and pem -\nphigus vulgaris. Consideration must also be given for GVHD, AGEP, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, and initially a toxic erythroderma. GVHD can show similar clinical and histologic features to TEN, so dis -\ntinguishing TEN from GVHD in a transplant patient may be difficult. AGEP may have confluent lakes of pus which can blister, but there is persistent intact epidermis. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome is excluded by his -\ntopathologic confirmation of a more superficial blister than that seen in TEN. There are many causes of acute erythroderma, but other than the blistering disorders, they do not progress to skin sloughing.\nHistopathologic Findings\nAlthough the classic target lesions of EM have a repro -\nducible, typical histopathologic appearance, the clini-cian must be aware that individual lesions evolve over several days, and that the histopathologic findings in an individual lesion will vary depending on when in a lesion\u2019s lifespan it is biopsied and if therapy has been initiated. Also, if the clinician samples a lesion with the clinical characteristics of erythema or urticaria rather than with those of a target lesion, the histopathologic appearance may mimic that of those conditions. Biopsy specimens should be taken from the periphery of target lesions, not from the center, to have the best chance of showing keratinocyte changes.\nTypical EM lesions show focal keratinocyte  necrosis \nand spongiosis associated with vacuolar alterations of basal epidermal cells that may progress to a dermoepi -\ndermal junction zone blister. Nonspecific  dermal changes \ninclude endothelial swelling, a superficial  perivascular \nmononuclear cell infiltrate, and papillary dermal edema. The basement membrane remains intact and the lesions do not produce scarring. Extravasation of erythrocytes does occur in the dermis, but leukocytoclasia (infiltration \nof neutrophils with nuclear fragmentation) and  fibrinoid \nnecrosis of blood vessel walls never occurs. Oral lesions show similar histopathologic changes.\nDirect immunofluorescence microscopy from lesions of \nEM is not diagnostic; however, a biopsy for immunofluo -\nrescence microscopy should be considered especially for mucosal lesions in the absence of skin lesions to exclude autoimmune bullous diseases such as paraneoplastic pem -\nphigus. In early lesions of EM, immunoreactants such as C\n3 and IgM may be detected in a granular pattern in the \ndermal blood vessels.\nThe histopathologic appearance of lesions of SJS and \nTEN may be identical to that of EM with extreme epi -\ndermal necrosis. The severity of the histologic findings in SJS and TEN is not associated with increased mortality. The cutaneous basement membrane remains at the base of the blister in TEN. Therefore, if secondary infection is prevented, it is believed that scarring will not occur; how -\never, clinically, results vary widely. Scarring may  occur on \nmucosal surfaces, the scalp, the fingernails, and the skin, probably as a result of secondary infection. A biopsy for routine processing should always be done, frozen sections for rapid diagnosis, and immunofluorescence should be considered in diagnostically uncertain cases.\nEvaluation\nThe evaluation of a patient with mucocutaneous disease must address both confirmation of the diagnosis and \n exclusion of significant underlying disease as a cause. \nThere is no specific laboratory abnormality associated with EM; therefore, the diagnosis is based on clinical parameters with histopathologic confirmation. Patients with EM may have leukocytosis, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, elevated liver function test results, proteinuria, and occasionally hematuria.\nIn addition to the routine histopathologic examina -\ntion, a bedside evaluation of oral mucosal blisters may involve a Tzanck smear. In this preparation, a blister is unroofed, the base of the blister is scraped firmly, and the material obtained is placed on a glass slide and stained with Wright, Giemsa, or other suitable stain.",

The \nincidence of rubella has decreased dramatically since the \nintroduction of a live attenuated vaccine in 1968. Trans -\nmission occurs by inhalation of infected respiratory drop -\nlets, with increased incidence during the spring months.\nClinical Manifestations\nAfter a 2- to 3-week incubation period, illness begins with \na mild prodrome consisting of malaise, anorexia, fever, \nheadache, and coryza. The cutaneous eruption appears \nfirst on the forehead and rapidly spreads inferiorly to in -\nvolve the face, trunk, and extremities. The lesions consist \nof pink macules and papules, which may become conflu -\nent, creating a scarlatiniform eruption (scarlet fever-like \nmacular erythema). Pruritus may be present. The time \ncourse of the rubella exanthem is 3 days, which is a dif -\nferentiating point from the usual 6-day course of the ru -\nbeola exanthem. The exanthem of rubella also does not \ndesquamate. There may be symmetric, tender, postauric -\nular, suboccipital, and posterior cervical lymphadenopa -\nthy. Petechiae on the soft palate, or Forschheimer spots, \nmay also be present. Arthritis and arthralgia are common \ncomplications of infection, especially in females.\nWidespread vaccination against rubella was devel -\noped largely for the prevention of congenital rubella \nsyndrome. Maternal infection during the first 16 weeks \nof gestation results in a 65% risk for congenital rubella. \nManifestations of congenital rubella syndrome include \nextramedullary hematopoiesis (blueberry muffin baby), \nthrombocytopenia, cataracts, deafness, and patent ductus \narteriosus. The impact of maternal infection on the fetus \ndrops precipitously after 20 weeks of gestation.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of rubella is made clinically and confirmed \nserologically.

Most \ncases develop during the winter or spring, and transmis -\nsion is by respiratory droplets.Clinical Manifestations\nMost infections due to parvovirus B19 are asymptomatic; \nhowever, in school-aged children erythema infectiosum \nis common. A mild prodrome of low-grade fever, coryza,  \nmalaise, and headache may present initially during  \nviremia. Soon thereafter the characteristic asymptomatic \nbilateral erythema of the cheeks with circumoral pallor, \noften referred to as a \u201cslapped cheek,\u201d appears. This may \nbe accompanied by pharyngitis, myalgia, diarrhea, nau -\nsea, or conjunctivitis.

It may oc -\ncur as a primary symptom of HIV, such as in eosinophilic folliculitis, insect bite hypersensitivity reaction, and pru-ritic papules of HIV. These papular pruritic eruptions cause severe itch. It continues to be a common symptom of HIV in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy.\nNEUROPATHIC ITCH\nNeuropathic itch has been defined as an itch initiated or caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction at any point along the afferent pathway of the nervous system. Char -\nacteristics of neuropathic itch that differentiate it from other forms of itch include associations with other senso -\nry symptoms in a dermatomal distribution and the pres -\nence of other neural damage, including motor damage or autonomic damage.\nNeuropathic itch can coincide with pain, as is seen \nin 30% to 40% of patients with postherpetic neuralgia. Characteristic sensory complaints associated with neuro -\npathic itch are burning, paresthesia, tingling, and sting -\ning. Localized itching can follow dermatomes at the level of C5\u2013C8, such as the dorsolateral aspect of the arms in brachioradial pruritus, and unilateral itch midback in der -\nmatomes at the level of T2\u2013T6 in notalgia paresthetica.\nPREGNANCY\nPregnant women may experience generalized pruritus as a result of cholestasis, which is common in pregnancy; in addition, several dermatoses of pregnancy, which are ex-tremely itchy, have been described, such as polymorphic eruption of pregnancy and pemphigoid (herpes) gestatio -\nnis (see Chapter 41).\nTREATMENT OF PRURITUS\nThere are no specific antipruritic drugs that benefit all forms of pruritus. Treatment depends on identifying and removing the cause, whether systemic or cutaneous. If treatment of the cause is not possible there are a number of preventive and therapeutic treatment options. Treat\n-\nments are divided into topical and systemic.\nhttp://e-surg.com",
        "abb55f70-d5b9-4824-b6cb-dea8f1bbbafb": "CHAPTER 42  Mast Cell Disease374\npapular, and macular lesions of mast cell disease have \nbeen reported to have respectively 150-, 40-, and eight- \nto ninefold increases in mast cell content compared \nto normal skin. Special stains, such as toluidine blue, \n Giemsa, and Leder, or monoclonal antibodies that rec -\nognize tryptase or CD117 (KIT) are helpful for iden -\ntifying tissue MCs. The proposed pathologic criteria \nfor skin involvement in mastocytosis patients include \neither the presence of >15 monomorphic MCs/cluster \nor >20 scattered MCs/hpf on microscopic evaluation of \na lesional skin biopsy specimen and the presence of a c-\nKIT mutation at the 816 codon. Normal-appearing skin \nfrom patients with mast cell disease has normal numbers \nof MCs, and skin biopsies of normal-appearing skin in \npatients with suspected mast cell disease are not help -\nful in establishing the diagnosis. Biopsies from either \nthe bone marrow or the gastrointestinal tract may be \nindicated for patients in whom the diagnosis of SM is \nexpected, but who lack skin lesions.\nDetection of circulating mast cell mediators and/\nor their metabolites can offer indirect evidence of mas -\ntocytosis ( Table 42-5 ). Two forms ( \u03b1 and \u03b2) of mast \ncell-derived tryptase have been identified. \u03b1-Tryptase \nis persistently elevated in patients with SM, and thus \nmay be useful for assessing total body mast cell burden.  \n\u03b2-Tryptase, on the other hand, is often detected in mast \ncell disease patients as well as in other hematologic dis -\norders and normal patients experiencing anaphylactic \nsymptoms. In one study, 50% of patients with total serum \ntryptase levels between 20 and 75 ng/mL had evidence of \nSM, whereas all patients with levels >75 ng/mL had prov -\nen systemic involvement. Of note, a total serum tryptase \nlevel >20 ng/mL represents one of the minor criteria for \nSM.38 Elevations in urinary histamine metabolites also \nhave been documented in some SM patients. In many in -\nstances, unmetabolized urinary histamine levels may be \nnormal in asymptomatic SM patients, whereas the major \nmetabolite of histamine, 1,4-methylimidazole acetic acid \n(MeImAA), is often persistently elevated. Certain foods \nwith high histamine content, such as spinach, eggplant \n(aubergine), cheeses (Parmesan, blue, and Roquefort), \nand red wines, can artificially elevate the levels of urinary \nhistamine and its metabolites. The major urinary me -\ntabolite of prostaglandin D2 (PGD 2), 9\u03b1,11\u03b2-dihydroxy-\n15-oxo-2,3,18,19-tetranorprost-5-ene-1,20-dioic acid \n(PGD 2M), has also been reported to be increased in some \nSM patients.PROGNOSIS\nMost children have CM and thus an excellent progno -\nsis with a limited disease course. Approximately 50% of \nthese patients are expected to have their disease resolved \nby adolescence, with the remainder noting a marked \nreduction in lesion numbers by adulthood. The overall \nprognosis of patients having ISM appears good. In a study \nof 145 adults with ISM, the cumulative probabilities of \ndisease progression to ASM at 10 and 25 years were 1.7% \nand 8.4%, respectively. Prognosis for patients with SM-\nAHNMD appears to be directly related to the severity of \nthe associated hematologic disorder. ASM patients have \nan unfavorable prognosis, with a mean survival of only a \nfew years, and the prognosis for MCL is also extremely \npoor, with an expected survival of a year or less from the \ntime of diagnosis.\nTREATMENT\nAt present there is no cure for mastocytosis; treatment \nis therefore directed at alleviating symptoms. Patients \nwith CMs and ISM often have few, if any, symptoms, \nand therefore require little or no therapy. Patients should \nbe cautioned to avoid potential mast cell-degranulating \nagents such as ingested alcohol, anticholinergic prepa -\nrations, aspirin, nonsteroidal agents, narcotics, and  \npolymyxin B sulfate. In addition, heat and friction can in -\nduce local or systemic symptoms, and therefore should \nbe avoided whenever possible.",

Because the \nduration of anagen is a major factor in determining hair \nlength, short anagen precludes growth of long hair. Some \nbelieve that this is the mechanism underlying chronic \ntelogen effluvium. Notably, shedding is typically not no -\nticed until the duration of anagen is reduced by 50%.\nImmediate Telogen Release\nImmediate telogen release results from a shortening of \nthe normal telogen cycle. There is good evidence that \ndrugs such as minoxidil exert their effect via immediate \ntelogen release, with affected follicles promptly stimu -\nlated to enter anagen. Telogen release typically begins \nwithin days of the insult, which accounts for the increased \nshedding some patients experience in the first days and \nweeks of minoxidil use.\nDelayed Telogen Release\nDelayed telogen release is far more common in the ani -\nmal kingdom than in humans. It is by this mechanism \nthat some animals shed their winter fur when spring ar -\nrives. Hair is shed synchronously as large numbers of \ntelogen hairs are released, giving way to a new anagen \ncycle. Although the exact mechanism is not clear, this \nprocess is thought to be driven by a neuro-optic signal. \nDelayed telogen release may also account for the seasonal \nshedding that some humans experience.\nTelogen Effluvium and Drugs\nMedications usually cause telogen effluvium in the form \nof immediate anagen release. Some of the more common -\nly associated drugs are listed in Table 43-3 . While these \nmedications span a wide range of drug classes, cardiovas -\ncular medications are heavily represented (anticoagulants, \nbeta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors). \nA few (i.e., captopril, quinacrine, nadolol, sulfasalazine) \nhave been associated with a histologically inflammatory \ntelogen effluvium. In the last 10 years, a number of new, \nbiologically targeted, chemotherapeutic agents have  \nbecome available. Among these new agents are sunitinib, \na multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, associated with \nalopecia in 6% of patients. Interestingly, sunitinib report -\nedly causes hair color change in approximately 10% of \npatients. While the mechanism of alopecia in patients \ntaking sunitinib is not clear, telogen effluvium has been \nhistologically confirmed in a patient taking a similar med -\nication, nolotinib. Similarly, selumetinib, a MEK1 and \nMEK2 inhibitor, causes alopecia in 9% of patients.\nTelogen Effluvium and Androgenetic \nAlopecia\nTelogen effluvium and androgenetic alopecia are both \nrelatively common diagnoses. When the two conditions \ncoexist, patients experience a pattern hair loss that pro -\ngresses more quickly than the usual course. Early-onset androgenetic alopecia is often accompanied by a brisk \nand episodic telogen effluvium. Androgenetic telogen ef -\nfluvium is related to shortened cycle times as large scalp \nterminal hairs are miniaturized and shortened second -\nary to decreased matrix volume and reduced duration of \nanagen, respectively. Hair shedding is obvious only when \nlarge terminal hairs are being shed. With ensuing hair \ncycles, the involved follicles produce progressively minia -\nturized (vellus) hairs, whose loss is inapparent.\nChronic Telogen Effluvium\nThe usual course of telogen effluvium is self-limited. \nChronic telogen effluvium occurs when the duration of \nhair shedding exceeds 6 months. Most  common in middle-\naged women, this is a diffuse, chronic, fluctuating form of \nhair loss that affects the entire scalp. Sometimes confused \nwith androgenetic alopecia, chronic telogen effluvium \nmay cause diffuse thinning and bitemporal recession, but \nsevere and obvious balding is rare. Notably, chronic telo -\ngen effluvium is a diagnosis of exclusion rather than being \nlinked to an identifiable underlying etiology.\nDiagnosis and Treatment\nThe distinctive history of abrupt onset, diffuse hair shed -\nding and an identifiable inciting event make telogen ef -\nfluvium a straightforward clinical diagnosis.",

In many cases, \nhair loss (alopecia) is the result, although excess hair \ngrowth may also occur.\nALOPECIA\nAlopecia has traditionally been subdivided into three \nmain categories: scarring (cicatricial), nonscarring (non -\ncicatricial), and hair shaft disorders. In addition, Solomon \nproposed the term \u201cbiphasic alopecia\u201d to describe forms \nof alopecia that are nonscarring early in their course, yet \nresult in scarring later in their course. Examples of bi -\nphasic alopecia include patterned hair loss and traction \nalopecia. Another proposed classification scheme divides \nhair loss into permanent and nonpermanent alopecia. For \nthe purposes of our discussion, we will continue to use \nthe terms scarring and nonscarring, as they are widely ac -\ncepted and firmly entrenched in the literature.\nHair loss in the setting of systemic disease may occur \nthrough one of five mechanisms ( Table 43-1 ): telogen \neffluvium, anagen arrest, and hair miniaturization (all \nforms of nonscarring alopecia); scarring alopecia; and \nhair shaft disorders. An important concept in the evalua -\ntion and diagnosis of hair disorders is that more than one \nmechanism may be operating at a given time. This can \namplify the degree of hair loss, modify its pattern, and \ncomplicate the clinical picture.\nTelogen Effluvium\nThe most common cause of hair loss associated with \nsystemic disease is telogen effluvium (TE). This form of \nnonscarring alopecia manifests with diffuse, nonscarring \nhair shedding, often with an abrupt onset. The shedding \nis a result of disruption of the normal hair cycle such that \na large number of hairs synchronize their growth cycles \nreaching a catagen and subsequent telogen phase around \nthe same time. This can be triggered by a metabolic or \nhormonal stress or by drugs (severe illness, infections, \nmedications, surgical procedures or anesthesia, and en -\ndocrinopathies). About 3 to 4 months (the time it takes for a hair to move through catagen and the early stages \nof telogen), after a precipitating event, normal-appearing \nclub hairs begin to fall out in large numbers. Often the \npatient may recall one of the precipitating events listed \nin Table 43-2 .\nAccording to Headington, telogen effluvium can be \nfurther divided into five subtypes, depending on which \nportion of the hair cycle is pathologically lengthened or \nshortened. These subtypes are immediate anagen release, \ndelayed anagen release, short anagen, immediate telogen \nrelease, and delayed telogen release. There is much over -\nlap between the types, and it is often impossible to distin -\nguish one from another in the clinical setting.\nImmediate Anagen Release\nImmediate anagen release accounts for most cases of \ntelogen effluvium. Most drugs and physiologic stressors \nincluding febrile illness trigger hair loss by this mecha -\nnism. As the name suggests, the anagen phase is cut short, \nand hairs prematurely enter the telogen phase. Immedi -\nate anagen release has a rapid onset, usually about 3 to \n5 weeks after the inciting event.\nDelayed Anagen Release\nDelayed anagen release occurs when hairs are retained in \nthe anagen phase longer than usual and then move on to \nthe catagen and telogen phase around the same time. A \nclassic example of delayed anagen release is postpartum \ntelogen effluvium. Metabolic and endocrine changes dur -\ning pregnancy prolong the anagen phase. Upon normal -\nization of these factors after delivery, hairs enter telogen, \nand new mothers experience heavy hair shedding. This \nalso accounts for the loss of lanugo hairs in a newborn, \nwhich occurs in a synchronous molt shortly after birth.",

In \nstudies from France, up to 50% of patients have had cutane -\nous disease. In addition, it appears that in these populations, \ncutaneous involvement is more commonly associated with \nnonhepatitis B virus-related systemic PAN (57.8% vs 35%). \nIn addition, these studies report that the most common skin \nlesions are purpura, followed by nodules and livedo reticu -\nlaris. Nodules usually measure between 0.5 cm and 2 cm in \ndiameter and are usually located on the legs or feet.

The AAV comprises \nthree different entities, namely, microscopic polyangiitis  \n(MPA), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), and  \neosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA). \nPatients with AAV exhibit vasculitic and nonvasculitic \nskin lesions, with a complex clinical and histopathologi -\ncal spectrum. Cutaneous vasculitic lesions usually present \nas palpable purpura in the lower extremities. Less com -\nmonly, cutaneous lesions such as livedo racemosa, nodu -\nlar erythema, or subcutaneous nodules may be observed.\nUnlike GPA, MPA does not have granulomatous \n inflammation. In MPA necrotizing glomerulonephritis \nis very common and lung capillaritis often occurs. Skin \ninvolvement is common (60%). Palpable purpura consti -\ntutes the main cutaneous manifestation (40%), followed \nby livedo and nodules (13% each), and urticaria (3.5%).\nGPA, formerly called Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis, is \ncharacterized by granulomatous inflammation usually \n involving the upper and lower respiratory tract.

The \nproportion of patients reported to have skin and muco -\nsal involvement varies between less than 15% and 46%. \n Cutaneous lesions are the presenting manifestations in \n10% to 21% of cases. Some authors have suggested that \nvasculitic cutaneous lesions could be correlated with the \nactivity and course of the disease. In this regard patients \nwith cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV) seem \nto have an earlier debut of GPA with a more rapidly \n progressive and widespread disease.\nEGPA, also called Churg-Strauss vasculitis, is charac -\nterized by an eosinophil-rich necrotizing granulomatous \ninflammation often involving the respiratory tract. It is \nassociated with asthma and eosinophilia, and nasal polyps \nare common. Between 40% and 81% of patients have cu -\ntaneous lesions, being the presenting sign of the disease \nin about 14% of cases. Palpable purpura of the lower ex -\ntremities is the most common manifestation  accounting \nfor up to 50% of patients with skin involvement. Urticarial \nlesions are not uncommon (12% to 31%). Other less fre -\nquent manifestations are papular/nodular lesions, livedo \nreticularis, ulcerations, bullous lesions, cutaneous infarcts, \nRaynaud\u2019s phenomenon, vesicles, and sterile pustules.\nNeutrophilic vasculitis (LCV characterized by a pre -\ndominant infiltrate of neutrophils mixed with nuclear dust) is the commonest histopathologic finding in skin \nlesions of patients with MPA and GPA.

This loss of subcutaneous tissue may appear in the context of genetic syndromes or in patients with HIV infection treated with protease inhibitors.\nIn most cases of lipoatrophy, the histopathologic find -\nings are those of a lipophagic granuloma surrounding a small-sized fat lobule, with perilobular fibrosis. In fully developed lesions of lipodystrophy, there is an absence of subcutaneous fat with deposition of new collagen and no evidence of inflammation. Recently, two histopathologic variants of lipodystrophy have been proposed, a first type showing prominent involutional changes of the fat lobule, \nFIGURE 12-3  n Pancreatic panniculitis: Multiple erythematous \ntender nodules were present in this patient with pancreatitis. \n(Courtesy of J.

In addition to recognizing its cause, recognition of this syndrome is also important because it may lead to poor glucose control despite increasing doses of insulin, and risk of hypoglycemia if the higher dose is now ad-ministered to a normal skin site. Given 20 earlier and 52 recently reported cases, this should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of nodules in diabetic patients in typical areas of insulin administration.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThe differential diagnosis for systemic amyloidoses depends on the syndrome, but AL amyloidosis should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of cephalad-distributed waxy papules or unexplained hem -\norrhage induced by mild trauma. Patients with the AA or familial syndromes of amyloid frequently have no specific cutaneous amyloid lesions. Lichen and macular amyloidosis may be confused with localized pigmentary disorders, lichen simplex chronicus, notalgia paresthetica, and prurigo nodularis.\nHistopathologic Findings\nSkin Biopsy\nA biopsy of clinical lesions in AL-derived systemic amy -\nloidosis should provide diagnostic evidence of amyloid \ndeposition. Amyloid deposits are usually located in the superficial dermis and dermal vessels. Epidermal atrophy (or at least the loss of rete ridges) is an associated find -\ning. Congo red staining with green birefringence under polarized light is the most specific stain for amyloid, al -\nthough other stains, such as methyl violet, crystal violet, or thioflavine T, may be more sensitive.\nDespite the rarity of clinical lesions in AA fibril-type \n(secondary) systemic amyloidosis, a biopsy of apparently normal skin may yield evidence of amyloid deposition. The pattern of amyloid deposition differs from that seen with the AL type. The deposits are usually deep in the dermis and subcutaneous fat, and are occasionally in a perivascular or periappendageal distribution. Amyloid deposition in hemodialysis-related amyloidosis and in several familial amyloid syndromes (dependent on trans -\nthyretin, gelsolin, or cystatin C) has been similar to that described for AA fibril-type amyloidosis. As discussed previously, subcutaneous fat pad aspiration is frequently positive in AL, AA, and perhaps other systemic amyloi-doses, but this test requires experience to interpret and to avoid overstaining the tissue with Congo red.\nLichen amyloidosis and macular amyloidosis have a \nbiopsy appearance unlike that of AL or AA amyloidosis. Amyloid is deposited in the papillary tips, with rete ridge elongation and sparing of dermal blood vessels. The changes in macular amyloidosis are sometimes minimal. Cutaneous tumor-associated amyloidosis is a pathologic curiosity; its recognition as an entity is important primar -\nily to prevent its misinterpretation as evidence of a more serious amyloid disorder. The cutaneous deposits in nodular cutaneous amyloidosis are localized to the nod -\nules. Extensive dermal and subcutaneous deposits within the lesions are typical, as is blood vessel wall infiltration. Plasma cells are usually prominent; giant cells and focal calcification may be seen.\nSubcutaneous Fat Aspiration\nSubcutaneous abdominal fat aspiration may be helpful in \nconfirming a diagnosis of systemic amyloidosis in patients with AL, AA, senile ATTR, or some familial amyloid syn -\ndromes. However, in the absence of laser microdissection with mass spectrometry of any amyloid present on the slide, it is not specific. AL, AA, and familial ATTR may each involve the kidneys; AL, senile (wild-type ATTR), and familial ATTR frequently result in cardiac dysfunc -\ntion, AL and senile ATTR both involve carpal tunnel, and AL and familial ATTR syndromes may cause neuropathy. Wild-type ATTR can induce a sporadic late-onset car -\ndiomyopathy that may affect up to 15% of men >80  years \nof age, and is not rare beginning with men >60  years of \nage. The familial syndromes of ATTR that result from any of at least 100 mutations in transthyretin can result \nin cardiomyopathy in patients as young as 20  years of age. \nEven the presence of a gammopathy may be misleading.

Cuta -\nneous hemorrhage as a result of Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome and pseudoxanthoma elasticum is usually caused by poor dermal tissue support.\nThe autoerythrocyte sensitization (Gardner\u2013Diamond) \nsyndrome is most likely factitious in its pathogenesis. The disorder occurs primarily in young women who often have significant emotional problems, and is manifested by the rapid development of unexplained noninflamma -\ntory purpura ( Fig. 15-8). Laboratory studies of immune \nfunction and coagulation are within normal limits. It is said that the injection of autologous erythrocytes will re-produce the lesions. Manipulation of injection sites by the patient has been demonstrated in some individuals with this diagnosis.\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\nPurpuric Lesion\nThe first task in unraveling the cause of purpura is to \nprove that the lesion is purpuric. The color of the lesion should be the result of hemoglobin, i.e., bright red for fully oxygenated; reddish-blue, blue-black, or purple for less-saturated hemoglobin; and blue-black to black for hemorrhage associated with hemorrhagic tissue necrosis. The brown pigmentation of hemosiderin (resulting from the breakdown of hemoglobin) can be impossible to dis -\ntinguish from melanin pigment, and it is therefore less reliable in establishing past hemorrhage.\nDiascopy\nNext, at least some of this color must be proved to reside extravascularly. This is done by diascopy, applying direct pressure to a lesion. This is generally done best by using the thicker glass of a pocket hand lens rather than thinner fragile glass slides. Direct lesional compression moves blood within the vessels away from the area, with at lease partial blanching. Blood in the dermis or clotted within the vessels cannot move. A critical assessment is whether a color appropriate for hemorrhage remains within the area being compressed.\nThree types of lesions can yield misleading informa -\ntion on diascopy. A tangled mat of small vessels may develop kinks or occluded sections while compressed, thereby trapping blood within vessel segments. A lesion may be too firm, or may develop over soft areas of the skin and simply be pushed into the skin without sufficient compression. For example, cherry (senile) angiomas may be firm, or if they overlie a prominent panniculus (such as on the abdomen) they may be impossible to compress. Finally, any cutaneous eruption may become hemor -\nrhagic when sufficiently traumatized or if it develops in an area of high hydrostatic pressure, e.g., a pruritic area traumatized by scratching, or an active dermatitis occurring near the ankle in an ambulatory patient. By contrast, the presence of symmetrical hemorrhage, es-pecially in dependent areas, or hemorrhage in lesions that the patient cannot easily scratch, and the absence of excoriations suggests that the hemorrhage is primary rather than secondary.\nInflammation\nHaving established a lesion as primary purpura, the next task to assess is the degree of inflammation using diascopy (see above). Nonpalpable petechiae and simple ecchymo -\nses typically show little or no color change on diascopy, and these represent lesions of simple hemorrhage. Many lesions of vasculitis contain elements of both inflamma -\ntion (erythema) and hemorrhage (purpura), depending on the pathogenesis of the vessel injury and the age of the lesion. Typical lesions of small-vessel leukocytoclastic vasculitis most commonly present as port-wine papules \n5 to 10  mm in diameter (classic palpable purpura), but a \nsubset of vasculitides may present as inflammatory reti-form purpura. When due to immune complex deposition, these lesions are concentrated in dependent areas (areas of the highest hydrostatic pressure), whereas clinically identical lesions associated with antineutrophil cytoplas -\nmic antibody (ANCA)-positive syndromes (e.g., GPA, microscopic polyangiitis [MPA]) are much more likely to occur in a random pattern of distribution.",

However, malig -\nnancies outside the abdomen and nonadenocarcinomas have been reported. The course of malignant AN parallels \nthe course of the tumor, which tends to be aggressive in \nnature. Malignant AN is a prototypic dermatological con -\ndition associated with malignancy, fulfilling all of Curth\u2019s \u201cpostulates\u201d except for having a genetic association.\nBazex Syndrome\nAcrokeratosis paraneoplastica, or Bazex syndrome, is by definition always associated with an underlying ma -\nlignancy. Acrokeratosis paraneoplastica develops pro-gressively through three stages. The initial cutaneous signs consist of erythematous to violaceous, poorly de-fined macules with a fine adherent scale that occur over the acral areas of the body, including the fingers, toes, ears, and nose. A paronychial reaction is also common. In the second stage, skin lesions begin to generalize and keratoderma develops. In the third stage, the  eruption \ngeneralizes but still maintains its violaceous nature and predilection for acral involvement ( Fig. 17-3). The three \nstages of the cutaneous disease parallel the growth and spread of the underlying tumor. Bazex syndrome is more common in men, and the underlying tumors are most often squamous cell carcinomas of the upper aerodiges-tive tract; however, a variety of other solid malignancies and lymphomas have also been associated. Therefore, a comprehensive head, neck, and pelvic examination with laboratory, radiographic, and endoscopic evaluation is needed. As with acanthosis nigricans, the course of cuta -\nneous involvement in Bazex syndrome typically parallels the course of the tumor, thereby fulfilling the criteria to consider it a marker of internal malignancy.\nBullous Dermatoses\nSeveral bullous dermatoses have been reported to be as -\nsociated with malignancy. Although the association be-tween bullous pemphigoid and cancer may be related primarily to the increased incidence of both conditions in elderly patients, certain other autoimmune bullous dermatoses with dermal epidermal junction pathology appear to be associated with an increased risk of malig -\nnancy, in particular those with negative immunofluo -\nrescence results, those with prominent mucosal lesions, and those with linear IgA disease. Egan and colleagues \nreported solid organ malignancies in 10 of 35 patients with antiepiligrin cicatricial pemphigoid (AECP). In \neight cases the cancer was discovered within 14  months of \nthe diagnosis of AECP. AECP is an uncommon, severe, and often scarring mucosal variant of pemphigoid associ -\nated with an IgG antibody directed against laminin 5.

It is manifested by \nsplenomegaly, but functional abnormalities are rare.\nMusculoskeletal Manifestations\nSymptomatic muscle involvement in sarcoidosis is rare, \nalthough biopsy-based detection of a sarcoidal infiltrate \nis not uncommon. Clinical series of large numbers of pa -\ntients with sarcoidosis reveal that approximately 1% have \nsymptoms of muscle involvement. However, when pa -\ntients with sarcoidosis undergo random muscle biopsies, \nmore than 50% have histologic evidence of granuloma -\ntous disease. At times, muscle involvement may appear as \nsubcutaneous nodules, although this is rare.\nBone lesions occur in 10% to 15% of patients, usually \ncorrelating with chronic progressive disease. The X-ray \nchanges are cystic lesions that usually occur in the ter -\nminal phalanges of the hands. These may be accompa -\nnied by soft tissue swelling ( Fig. 36-15 ). Arthralgias are \ncommonly experienced in acute sarcoidosis, particularly \nin patients with L\u00f6fgren\u2019s syndrome, and may be accom -\npanied by arthritis. The wrists, knees, and ankles are the \nmost commonly affected joints. Although chronic granu -\nlomatous arthritis has been reported, it is a rare complica -\ntion of systemic sarcoidosis.\nNeurosarcoidosis\nNeurosarcoidosis affects 5% to 15% of patients with sys -\ntemic sarcoidosis. Central nervous system involvement \noccurs in 50% of patients with neurosarcoidosis. The \npresence of neurosarcoidosis correlates with the pres -\nence of posterior uveitis and chronic cutaneous disease.  \nThe most common neurologic manifestations of sarcoidosis include cranial neuropathies such as optic nerve disease or \nfacial nerve palsy, meningitis, and cerebral granulomas, \nwhich can lead to encephalopathy and seizures. Heer -\nfordt\u2013Waldenstr\u00f6m syndrome is also frequently associated \nwith central nervous system involvement. The detection \nof neurosarcoidosis can be difficult because affected tis -\nsue is not readily available for microscopic evaluation. \nThe evaluation of a patient with suspected neurosarcoid -\nosis can include skull X-ray studies, electroencephalog -\nraphy, a CT scan, and/or magnetic resonance imaging of \nthe brain. Lumbar puncture may also be useful in patients \nwith meningeal involvement. Small-fiber neuropathy can \noccur due to sarcoidosis and can present with peripheral \nnerve symptoms, including atypical pain.\nHepatic Sarcoidosis\nHepatic involvement in sarcoidosis is common. In a large \nstudy, hepatomegaly was detected in 20% to 50% of pa -\ntients with sarcoidosis. Abnormal liver function tests are \npresent in approximately half of patients with hepatic in -\nvolvement. Liver biopsy may be useful to obtain tissue to \nestablish a diagnosis of sarcoidosis, although care must be \ntaken to exclude other causes of granulomatous disease \nof the liver, and the findings must be correlated with evi -\ndence of sarcoidal disease elsewhere in the body. Hepatic \ninvolvement rarely progresses to functional abnormalities \nor cirrhosis. Combined hepatosplenomegaly is associated \nwith a poorer outcome owing to the higher overall body \ngranuloma and fibrosis burden.\nEndocrine, Metabolic, and Laboratory \nAbnormalities\nEndocrine glands may be infiltrated by sarcoidal granulo -\nmas. Functional abnormalities are not common, although \npituitary or hypothalamic infiltration can cause diabetes \ninsipidus or, on rare occasions, panhypopituitarism. An \nelevated prolactin level is a useful indicator of hypotha -\nlamic sarcoidal involvement. A number of studies have \nindicated a potential increased risk of thyroid disease in \npatients with sarcoidosis, although it is not clear if that is \ndue to direct granulomatous inflammation or shared au -\ntoimmune inflammation. Other endocrine organs, such \nas the parathyroid and adrenal glands and the pancreas, \nmay be involved. However, functional impairment of \nthese organs is unusual.\nHypercalcemia occurs in some patients with sarcoidosis.",

It has rarely been reported in the absence \nof underlying systemic illness. In addition to connec -\ntive tissue diseases, PNGD is also noted to be asso -\nciated with underlying malignancy, most commonly \nlymphoproliferative disorders, and infections such as \nHIV. Rare reports have described the development of \nPNGD secondary to medications such as TNF antago -\nnists and allopurinol.\nClinical Manifestations\nAlthough the clinical presentation of PNGD varies, it \nclassically presents as erythematous and skin-colored \npapules and nodules on the extensor surfaces of the ex -\ntremities with a predilection for the elbows and fingers \n(Fig. 7-3 ). A review of 81 patients with PNGD revealed \nthat 51% of cases involved the upper extremities, 27.7% \ninvolved the lower extremities, and 21% had lesions on \nthe head or neck. The lesions of PNGD can be umbili -\ncated or crusted with associated pain.

Diarrhea, irritability, and fail -\nure to thrive develop simultaneously with the cutane -\nous eruptions in zinc deficiency, confirming clinical \nsuspicion.\nThe onset of symptoms of genetic zinc deficiency usu -\nally occurs from 3 weeks to 18 months in infancy, after \nchanging from breast milk to cow\u2019s milk. Low-molecular-\nweight binding factor transports zinc into the epithelial \ncells of the intestine and is present in human breast milk. \nLow-molecular-weight zinc-binding factor in breast milk \nis responsible for the superior absorption of zinc from hu -\nman milk. Zinc deficiency has also been reported with the \nabsence of zinc-binding factor in deficient breast milk. \nAlopecia, diarrhea, growth retardation, neuropsychiatric \ndisorders, and recurrent infections ensue if the disorder \ngoes unrecognized.\nEvaluation\nMeasurement of plasma zinc concentration is diagnostic, \nprovided the sample is not hemolyzed or contaminated. \nParticular care needs to be taken to ensure that test tubes \nand other measurement equipment are free of zinc. Low -\nered zinc levels in plasma may occur in the absence of \ntrue zinc deficiency. Levels fall nonspecifically in the \nacute phases of cardiac, hepatic, renal, pulmonary, neuro -\nlogic, infectious, and malignant disorders. Zinc levels in \nred blood cells and hair may also be assessed to determine \nbody zinc status, but these are generally less reliable tests. \nUrinary excretion of zinc is reduced as a result of zinc de -\nficiency. Determination of 24-hour urinary zinc helps to \ndiagnose hyperzincuria and plasma zinc deficiency caused \nby excessive alcohol intake and chronic renal disease. Se -\nrum alkaline phosphatase, a zinc metalloenzyme, is fre -\nquently depressed.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nClassic acrodermatitis enteropathica is clinically char -\nacteristic when the perioral, perirectal, and digital areas \nare affected. Incomplete expression of these skin findings \nmay be confused with perioral dermatitis, hand dermati -\ntis, candidiasis, and pustular psoriasis. As the dermatitis \nworsens, secondary colonization and infection with bac -\nteria and Candida albicans  can occur.\nBiotin deficiency may present as periorificial derma -\ntitis and alopecia. It occurs in those who consume an \nunbalanced diet containing excessive amounts of raw \negg whites. Biotin binds to avidin found in egg whites, \nresulting in malabsorption of biotin from the intestinal \ntract. The perioral and intertriginous localization of early \nglucagonoma syndrome may also be confused with zinc \ndeficiency.\nZinc deficiency can be corrected easily by oral sup -\nplementation. If the intake of animal protein is ade -\nquate, 15 to 30 mg daily of zinc sulfate is adequate. If \ndietary protein intake is predominantly in the form of \ncereals, 50 to 200 mg daily may be needed. Response to \ntherapy is dramatic. Skin lesions, diarrhea, and behav -\nioral abnormalities reverse within days to weeks. Hair \ngrowth and growth retardation improve over the course \nof months.Dermatitis Herpetiformis\nDermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a cutaneous manifestation \nof celiac disease. It presents as grouped erythematous pap -\nules and vesicles over the extensor surfaces of the forearms, \nelbows, knees, and buttocks. Biopsy reveals a blister at the \nbasement membrane with the accumulation of neutrophils \nin dermal papillary tips. The diagnosis is confirmed with a \nbiopsy of perilesional skin revealing deposition of granular \nimmunoglobulin A (IgA) in dermal papillary tips.\nMore than 85% of patients with DH demonstrate some \ndegree of small bowel inflammation on jejunal biopsy, \nwhich is generally less severe than that in celiac disease. \nThe attendant symptoms and signs of malabsorption are \nproportional to the severity of the gluten-sensitive enter -\nopathy. DH is discussed in detail in Chapter 16 . The pres -\nent discussion of DH will be limited to the association with \nmalabsorption.\nPathogenesis\nMore than 90% of DH patients have a characteristic hu-\nman leukocyte antigen  (HLA) genotype.

Classic neurofibromatosis (type 1 or \nNF1\u2014OMIM #162200) as described by von Reckling -\nhausen is characterized by multiple caf\u00e9-au-lait mac -\nules, cutaneous neurofibromas, and myriad systemic \ninvolvement with marked variability of expression. \nAcoustic neurofibromatosis (type 2 or NF2\u2014OMIM \n#101000) presents with bilateral acoustic neuromas as \nwell as caf\u00e9-au-lait macules and cutaneous neurofibro -\nmas. The gene for NF2 is localized on chromosome 22 \nand encodes a negative growth regulator called MER -\nLIN. Schwannomatosis (neurilemmomatosis\u2014OMIM \n#162091) is characterized by multiple noncutaneous \nschwannomas in the absence of acoustic tumors. Mu -\ntations in the tumor suppressor genes SMARCB1 and \nLZTR1 are thought to be responsible for the majority \nof cases. Segmental (dermatomal) neurofibromatosis is \na syndrome where caf\u00e9-au-lait macules, cutaneous neu -\nrofibromas, and sometimes visceral neurofibromas are \nlimited to a sharply defined unilateral body segment. \nWatson\u2019s syndrome, a variant of NF1, has multiple \ncaf\u00e9-au-lait macules, short stature, and pulmonary val -\nvular stenosis, but only a small number of neurofibro -\nmas. This discussion will be limited to NF1 and the \nterm \u201cneurofibromatosis\u201d is used to refer to only that \ndisorder.\nPathogenesis\nNeurofibromatosis is an autosomal dominant disorder \naffecting approximately 1 in 3000 live births. De novo \nmutations represent around 50% of patients with neu -\nrofibromatosis. Penetrance approaches 100% by age 20, \nbut the expressivity is highly variable. With an estimated mutation rate of 1 in 10,000 per gamete per generation, \nthe NF1 gene has one of the highest mutation rates of \nany genetic disorder. Currently over 1000 pathogenic \nvariants in NF1 have been identified. About 90% of \nnew mutations occur on the paternally derived chromo -\nsome with the majority causing truncation of the gene \nproduct.\nThe NF1 gene has been localized to chromosome \n17q11.2. The basic defect lies in the abnormal expression \nof a tumor suppressor gene called neurofibromin. This \ngene product has functional and structural homology \nwith a guanosine triphosphatase-activation protein (GT -\nPase) that downregulates p21ras proto-oncogene activity. \nIn its active (GTP) state, the p21ras protein binds guanine \nnucleotides with high affinity, acting as a signal trans -\nducer for cellular proliferation. Neurofibromin switches \noff this signaling by hydrolyzing GTP to guanosine di -\nphosphate ( Fig. 40-1 ). A defect in neurofibromin would \nresult in a constitutively active p21ras protein leading to \ncell growth and possible tumor formation. Interestingly, \nneurofibromin is found in the skin, brain, spleen, liver, \nand muscle, not just in the neural crest cells. The abnor -\nmal proliferation seen in neurofibromatosis is focused on \nthe neural crest for reasons that are not yet clear at the \nmolecular level.\nIt is generally believed that a somatic \u201csecond hit\u201d \nmutation with loss of heterozygosity results in the pro -\ngression of malignant tumors and possibly in the forma -\ntion of benign neurofibromas. However, given the wide \nclinical phenotypes found even among close relatives, \na defect in the neurofibromin protein cannot in itself \nexplain this variability. Other studies point to evidence \nthat modifying genes (genes that are unlinked to the \nNF1 gene, but play a phenotypical role in neurofibro -\nmatosis) may be behind these differences.",

A lym -\nphocutaneous pattern, also referred to as sporotrichoid, \nis commonly observed with the initial papule or nodule at \nthe site of inoculation and the subsequent development of \nnodules along the path of lymphatic drainage. In immu -\nnocompromised hosts, the clinical appearance of atypical \nmycobacterial infections can be muted due to the sup -\npression of inflammation, or exaggerated due to the sup -\npression of host defenses, i.e., they can vary from subtle \nerythema to large, nonhealing ulcers.\nThe diagnosis of cutaneous mycobacterial infections \ndepends on the identification of acid-fast bacilli in biopsy \nspecimens and isolation of the responsible organisms by \nspecialized culture techniques.

Specific multidrug \ntreatment regimens are dictated by the species isolated \nand the antibiotic sensitivities ( www.cdc.gov/mmwr/prev\niew/mmwrhtml/rr5211a1.htm ).\nThe treatment of cutaneous mycobacterial infections \nis complex and is dependent on the extent of the disease, \nthe species, and the degree of immunosuppression. The \ntreatment of infections with typical mycobacteria requires \nthree of the following agents: isoniazid, rifampicin, pyra -\nzinamide, and ethambutol. In the case of multidrug resis -\ntance, a combination with quinolones or clarithromycin is \nconsidered. These medications can impact blood levels and \nefficacy of concomitant immunosuppressive agents and \nshould be carefully monitored. For deep cutaneous infec -\ntions, surgical excision may be essential in order to reduce \nlarge collections of mycobacterial infection. Additionally, \nrevision of immunosuppression to bolster the immune \nresponse may be essential for successful treatment of any \nmycobacterial infection in the immunosuppressed patient.\nFungal\nSuperficial Fungi\nSuperficial fungal infections are due primarily to yeasts, \nin particular Candida  spp., and dermatophytes, especially \nTrichophyton rubrum  and T. mentagrophytes . Cutaneous candidiasis is exacerbated by oral corticosteroids and \nbroad-spectrum antibiotics as well as hyperglycemia, a \nconfounding problem in many renal transplant patients. \nThe clinical presentations include oral thrush, perl\u00e8che, \nonycholysis, chronic paronychia, onychomycosis of the \nfingernails, intertrigo, balanitis, and vulvovaginitis.

The primary manifestations are pityriasis (tin -\nea) versicolor and pityrosporum folliculitis ( Fig. 39-8 ).  \nDiagnoses of these yeast infections can be accomplished \nby examination of a potassium hydroxide (KOH) prepa -\nration and, in the case of candidiasis, fungal culture.",

It has been reported to be more \nsensitive for diagnosis than patch testing, but has some \nlimitations. First, although it has been found to be posi -\ntive in the majority of cases of exanthematous reactions, \nthe drug hypersensitivity syndrome, and AGEP, it is only \nrarely positive in cases of TEN, fixed drug eruption, and \nvasculitis. Second, timing of the test is important, with cas -\nes of the drug hypersensitivity syndrome showing a nega -\ntive test in the first few weeks after onset of the eruption. \nFinally, the test is not available at most clinical centers.\nIn vivo tests include skin testing and provocation or \noral rechallenge and also patch testing. Prick tests have \nbeen found to be a useful diagnostic tool in cases of sen -\nsitivity to \u03b2-lactams and muscle relaxants used in anes -\nthesia. Intradermal testing can be performed when prick \ntests are negative. To date, penicillin is the most widely \nused systemic drug for which intradermal skin testing is \nsignificantly reliable. Patients with the majority of impor -\ntant drug reactions, including SJS and TEN, exanthema -\ntous reactions, vasculitis, and erythroderma, should not \nundergo this form of testing.\nPatch testing for cutaneous drug reactions has been \nstudied the most vigorously of all the skin tests. Sensitiv -\nity varies depending on the type of reaction, the putative \ndrug, the concentration of drug tested, and, for fixed drug \neruptions, the site at which the patch is placed. Positive \nresults have been obtained in cases of exanthematous re -\nactions, fixed drug eruption, AGEP, and the drug hyper -\nsensitivity syndrome. Sensitivity has varied between 30% \nand 50%. The specificity and negative predictive value \nhave not been determined.\nEstablishment of the final diagnosis is the final step in \nthe diagnosis. If a definite diagnosis is not possible then a \nprioritization diagnosis must be completed by combining \nthe information gathered. The traditional approach of \nhighly probable, probable, possible, unlikely, and  almost \nexcluded are helpful. The Naranjo assessment classifies a \ndrug reaction as definite, probable, and possible. To ful -\nfill the criteria for a definite reaction four components \nmust be met. These include (1) temporal relationship, (2) \na recognized response to the suspected drug, (3) improve -\nment after drug withdrawal, and (4) reaction on rechal -\nlenge. A probable reaction includes parts 1 to 3 but does \nnot include rechallenge and a possible reaction only re -\nquires a temporal relationship.\nDiscontinuation of drug therapy and resumption of \ntherapy with the drug in question at a later time may \nallow immunologic effector mechanisms to \u201crecharge\u201d \nfully, making large-scale discontinuation of all drugs the \npatient is receiving worthy of careful scrutiny. The po -\ntential for the disease being treated to worsen after drug \ndiscontinuation has to be considered in dechallenge de -\ncisions. Each case should be handled individually, with \na consideration of the risks and benefits of discontinu -\ning drug therapy. In managing patients with high-risk \nreaction patterns, rechallenge with the drug in question \nshould be carried out only in very rare circumstances, \nwhen the need to know the responsible drug exceeds the risk of a severe reaction with the rechallenge. Inten -\ntional rechallenge can be performed only when a clinical \npresentation meets the criteria in Table 47-5 . Reports \nof patients with accidental rechallenge provide useful \ninformation on drug causes, but it is essential to avoid \nsuch accidental rechallenge. It is important to note that \nrechallenge is not optimally sensitive or specific. Despite \nthese limitations, rechallenge, when indicated, is the best \nway to identify accurately the causative drug in the clini -\ncal setting. The presence or absence of drug\u2013drug and \ndrug\u2013virus interactions should always be considered in \nthis diagnostic step.\nThe technique of \u201creverse challenge\u201d seems most \nreasonable and practical when there is one drug of high \nsuspicion and several others of lower suspicion that were \nstarted simultaneously prior to the cutaneous drug erup -\ntion.",

Disease can be self-limited as \nin EM or potentially fatal as in TEN. The current clinical \nclassification of EM, SJS, and TEN is based on pattern \nand distribution of skin lesions and maximum extent of \nskin detachment. However, the clinical classification of \nthese diseases is often debated, and although there is a \nbetter understanding of the molecular events leading to \nthe disease state, there remains no standard of care for \ntreatment.\nEM is the least severe of the mucocutaneous reac -\ntions. It is self-limited, characterized by classic true \ntarget lesions\u2014with three zones of inflammation\u2014in \nthe absence of widespread skin sloughing; there is vari -\nable mucous membrane involvement, and causality \n frequently from herpes simplex virus (HSV) or less often \nother causes. When systemic symptoms or extensive skin \nsloughing is present, with or without targetoid lesions or \nmucosal involvement, the diagnoses of SJS and TEN are \nconsidered .PATHOGENESIS\nImmune-mediated pathogenesis has long been suspected \nfor EM, SJS, and TEN. Current concepts center on host \nimmune response to various specific antigenic stimuli \nfrom drugs and infections. In EM patients, cutaneous \n lesions often result from cytotoxic reactions against HSV \nantigens expressed in epidermal keratinocytes. For the \nvast majority of patients with SJS and TEN, a cytotoxic \nreaction results from immunoreactivity against keratino -\ncytes expressing drug-related antigens. Evidence supports \na theory that patients are immunogenetically predisposed \nto developing their disease.\nMultiple etiologic agents have been implicated as \ncauses of EM, SJS, and TEN ( Table 11-1 ). The best-\ndocumented causes of EM include HSV and Mycoplasma  \npneumoniae . Fragments of HSV DNA can be found \nin the cutaneous lesions of EM in more than 80% of \ncases. While many drugs have been reported to cause \nEM, such cases may lack classic target lesions and are \ncurrently often labeled as mild SJS. Other associations \ninclude mononucleosis, other viral infections (e.g., \nmumps, poliomyelitis, milker\u2019s nodule, and  vaccinia), \ngranuloma inguinale, psittacosis, histoplasmosis, \nsyphilis, streptococcal infection, radiation therapy of \ntumors, sarcoidosis, pregnancy, carcinomas, reticulo -\nses, leukemias, systemic lupus erythematosus (Rowell\u2019s \nsyndrome), and other collagen\u2013vascular diseases. A \nsignificant percentage of cases remain idiopathic.\nAlthough there is a complex interplay between host \nimmune cells, CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural  \nkiller cells appear mainly responsible for the keratino -\ncyte apoptosis seen in the mucocutaneous reactions. \nThe mechanism of immune cell activation is theorized \nto be secondary to the pro-hapten concept, p-i concept, \nor both. In the pro-hapten concept drug metabolites \nbind to cellular peptides creating a highly immuno -\ngenic molecule capable of immune system activation. \nIn the p-i concept the drug or drug metabolite can bind \ndirectly to MHC or T-cell receptors and stimulate an \nimmune response.\nSeveral MHC I allotypes have been associated with \nincreased incidence of SJS and TEN.

It is caused by \nan immunologic reaction of immunocompetent donor  \nT lymphocytes in a recipient who is incapable of reject -\ning the graft. T-cell depletion of the allograft reduces the \nrisk of GVHD but is associated with a higher incidence \nof tumor recurrence and graft failure. The reason for the \nhigher risk of recurrence is the lack of a graft-versus-\ntumor effect. As a result, most transplants are still car -\nried out with unmodified (i.e., T-cell replete) grafts and \nare associated with a significant risk of acute and chronic \nGVHD.\nTreatment of recurrent lymphomas and leukemias \nafter allogeneic transplant includes a rapid reduction \nin immunosuppression and infusions of donor T lym -\nphocytes. The major risk of these strategies is GVHD, \nand as a result the clinician is constantly trying to bal -\nance tumor control on the one hand with GVHD on \nthe other.\nAcute GVHD\nGVHD is classically divided into acute (<100 days post \ntransplant) and chronic (>100 days post transplant), but \nthis division has become less distinct with currently  \nemployed protocols. Significant acute GVHD occurs in \n25% to 40% of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell trans -\nplant patients. Risk factors include an unrelated (but \nmatched) donor, a related donor but with a mismatch at \none or more human leukocyte antigens, an unmodified \ngraft, an older age of the donor or the recipient, and a \nfemale donor with a male recipient.\nIn acute GVHD the major sites of involvement are the \nskin, liver (hepatitis), and gastrointestinal tract (diarrhea). \nThe cutaneous eruption is reminiscent of the common \nmaculopapular (morbilliform) drug eruption. The initial \nlesions often appear on the hands and feet ( Fig. 39-20 ). \nThere is a grading system for acute cutaneous GVHD, \nFIGURE 39-20  n Erythematous macules and papules on the palm \nof a patient 30 days post-allogeneic bone marrow transplant.",

This involvement correlates well with \nthe severity of the muscle disease and is corticosteroid \nresponsive. Distal dysphagia is related to the involvement \nof nonstriated muscle and appears to be more frequent in \npatients who have overlap syndromes. Distal dysphagia \nmay also be accompanied by symptoms of reflux esopha \u00ad\ngitis. In general, dysphagia portends a poor prognosis and \nis often associated with pulmonary involvement.\nPulmonary disease occurs in approximately 15% to \n30% of patients with dermatomyositis and polymyositis. \nIt can be characterized by a primary diffuse interstitial \nfibrosis that may be manifested radiologically, or by ab \u00ad\nnormalities seen on pulmonary function testing. Pulmo \u00ad\nnary disease may also occur as a direct complication of \nthe muscular disease, such as hypoventilation or aspira \u00ad\ntion in patients with dysphagia, or it may be a result of \ntreatment, such as with opportunistic infections or drug\u00ad\ninduced hypersensitivity pneumonitis. It is important to \nnote that patients with amyopathic dermatomyositis may \nhave aggressive lung disease even in the absence of myo \u00ad\nsitis. Overall, pulmonary complications have been asso \u00ad\nciated with a poor prognosis. Data have suggested that \npatients with myositis who have Jo\u00ad1 antibodies are at a \ngreater risk for pulmonary involvement. In fact, 70% of \npatients with Jo\u00ad1 antibodies have interstitial lung dis \u00ad\nease. The antisynthetase syndrome is the constellation of \ninterstitial lung disease, myositis, polyarthritis, Raynaud\u2019s \nphenomenon, fever, and mechanic\u2019s hands in a patient \nwith antitransfer RNA autoantibodies.\nCardiac disease may also occur in patients with in \u00ad\nflammatory myopathy, as manifested by myocarditis or \npericarditis. Pericarditis appears to be more common in \npatients with overlapping features of other connective tis \u00ad\nsue diseases. Myocarditis can result in conduction defects, \narrhythmias, or, when severe, congestive heart failure.\nCalcinosis of the skin or muscle is unusual in adults but \nmay occur in up to 40% of children with dermatomyosi \u00ad\ntis. Calcinosis cutis is manifested by firm, yellow\u00adwhite, \nor skin\u00adcolored nodules, often over bony prominences. \nOccasionally, these nodules can extrude through the sur \u00ad\nface of the skin, in which case secondary infections may \noccur. Calcification of the muscles is often asymptomatic \nand may be seen only on radiologic examination. In se \u00ad\nvere forms, the calcinosis can cause loss of function, and, \nrarely, bone formation is possible.\nPregnancy has been shown to have an effect on the \ninflammatory myopathy. In addition, the inflammatory \nmyopathy may produce profound effects on the neonate \nand/or the mother. Studies suggest that dermatomyositis \nand/or polymyositis may be activated during pregnancy, \nor that the initial manifestations may be appreciated dur \u00ad\ning pregnancy. In addition, in a large group of women \nwith multiple pregnancies, premature delivery, spontane \u00ad\nous abortions, perinatal deaths, and fetal loss were more \ncommon in patients with active myositis.\nAMYOPATHIC DERMATOMYOSITIS\nAn evolving topic in the realm of dermatomyositis is how \nto classify and refer to patients with only or predominantly cutaneous disease. It is becoming more widely accepted \nthat a subset of patients will have skin\u00adlimited disease, \nsimilar to patients with lupus limited to the skin rather \nthan with systemic involvement. This is a change from \nthe previous notion that all patients with dermatomyositis \nwould by definition have some degree of muscle involve \u00ad\nment if physicians simply investigated sufficiently to find \nit. In the current nomenclature, clinically amyopathic \ndermatomyositis includes patients with both amyopathic \nand hypomyopathic dermatomyositis, subgroups which \ncomprise approximately 20% of the total population of \ndermatomyositis patients according to the best existing \nepidemiologic data.\nAmyopathic dermatomyositis has been recognized to \ninclude a unique subset of patients with typical cutaneous \ndisease for at least 6 months without weakness or abnormal \nmuscle enzymes or testing.",

This is roughly one-fifth the incidence of multiple myeloma, and about the same incidence as Hodgkin\u2019s disease or Ph1-positive chronic granulocytic leukemia. Men account for 60% to 65% of cases, and \nonly 1% of patients are under the age of 20  years. Fatigue \nand weight loss are the most common presenting symp-toms. Light-headedness is also common, and may be sec-ondary to nephrotic syndrome with volume contraction, to cardiac amyloidosis with low stroke volume, or to au -\ntonomic neuropathy with orthostatic hypotension.\nThe light-chain-derived systemic amyloidoses (amy -\nloid light-chain fibril, or AL) occur in the setting of pri -\nmary systemic amyloidosis and an associated plasma cell dyscrasia. True myeloma-associated amyloidosis is un -\ncommon. Even when patients with AL amyloidosis have >10% plasma cells in the bone marrow, lytic bone le -\nsions, myeloma cast nephropathy, and anemia secondary to marrow replacement are rare. It is assumed that all AL fibril-type systemic amyloidoses are caused by a mono -\nclonal protein. Blood or urine immunofixation studies for monoclonal immunoglobulin or light-chain protein are positive in nearly 90% of cases, and both should be obtained if AL amyloidosis is suspected. Even in those instances in which no monoclonal abnormality can be detected, the problem is thought to be one of test sen -\nsitivity. More recently, the serum-free light-chain assay, which is nearly 100% sensitive, has improved diagnostic accuracy; in contrast to immunofixation, it is a quantita -\ntive assay. Subcutaneous fat aspiration is positive in 70% to 80% of patients with AL amyloidosis.\nThe reported incidence of cutaneous lesions in AL-\nderived systemic amyloidosis ranges from 10% to 40%.

First associated \nwith uremia in 1898 by White, it was not until 1962 that \nSelye constructed an experimental model in nephrecto -\nmized rats in which he precipitated systemic calcification \nsimilar to the human syndrome. Between 1% and 4% of \ndialysis patients develop calciphylaxis. Reports of calci -\nphylaxis in nonuremic settings also exist, often in asso -\nciation with malignancy, alcoholic liver disease, primary \nhyperparathyroidism, diabetes mellitus, Crohn\u2019s disease, \nor connective tissue diseases. Although the pathogenesis \nremains obscure, hypercoagulable states, including pro -\ntein C and protein S abnormalities as well as the presence \nof antiphospholipid antibodies, have been detected in pa -\ntients with calciphylaxis; it is plausible that intrinsic co -\nagulation may contribute to tissue necrosis. Risk factors \nfor calciphylaxis include hypercalcemia, use of calcium-\ncontaining phosphate binders, vitamin D therapy, hy -\nperphosphatemia, elevated calcium-phosphate product, \nhyperparathyroidism, female gender, diabetes mellitus, \nobesity, systemic corticosteroid use, immunosuppres -\nsion, hypercoagulable conditions, and trauma.\nCalciphylaxis develops as exquisitely painful, often \nsymmetric, retiform purpuric plaques that frequently ul -\ncerate; anatomic areas with significant subcutaneous fat \nare more often affected ( Fig. 38-2 ). Early lesions may ap -\npear as nonspecific violaceous mottling, livedo reticularis, \nor erythematous papules, nodules, or plaques. Later-\nstage lesions typically have stellate purpura with central \nnecrosis; lesions in variable stages of development may \nbe present in the same patient. Laboratory abnormalities \nmay include hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia with \nan elevated calcium-phosphate product, generally greater \nthan 60 to 70 mg2/dL2.\nSkin biopsy specimens reveal calcification within the \nmedia of small- and medium-sized arterioles with ex -\ntensive intimal hyperplasia and fibrosis commonly with \na mixed inflammatory infiltrate ( Fig. 38-3 ). Subcutane -\nous calcium deposits with panniculitis and fat necrosis, \nas well as vascular microthrombi, are occasionally seen.",

It is used in treat -\ning pediatric ALL and some mast cell tumors, and is avail -\nable as an injection. While pain and edema at the injection \nsite are common, a hypersensitivity reaction associated with Escherichia coli- or polyethylene glycol-asparaginase is the \nmain dermatologic manifestation, which may manifest with pruritus and urticaria (often in the context of dyspnea and hypotension) at a rate of 3% to 45%. On rare occasions, TEN may develop. The hypersensitivity reactions may lead to discontinuation of therapy. The newly developed aspara-ginase produced from an alternate bacteria source, Erwinia chrysanthemi, has low cross-reactivity rate to the E. coli- \nasparaginase. Switching to E. chrysanthemi-asparaginase \nin patients who cannot tolerate E. coli-asparaginase has \na hypersensitivity rate of 6% to 33%, with limited high grade reactions (3.6%) (Burke, 2014).\nBleomycin\nBleomycin is an antibiotic isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces verticillus, which is used in the treatment of various solid tumors and leukemias. It induces DNA strand breaks. However, the exact mechanism of action has not been fully delineated. Hyperpigmentation, Rayn -\naud\u2019s phenomenon, gangrene, fibrosis, NEH, alopecia, edema, nail changes, and a characteristic \u201cflagellate\u201d ery -\nthema (erythemato-violaceous linear streaks on the trunk and/or shoulders) have been reported. Less frequently encountered AEs include angioedema, AGEP, and SJS.\nThalidomides\nThe antiangiogenic and immunomodulatory and anti-  \ninflammatory effects of the thalidomide class of drugs  \n(prototype, thalidomide; analogs, lenalidomide, pomalid-\nomide) have prompted evaluation of the latter in the treat-\nment of cancer. Currently, thalidomide is  approved strictly  \nfor the treatment of MM, in combination with dexametha -\nsone. These otherwise highly teratogenic drugs are associ -\nated with exfoliative rash, erythroderma, allergic vasculitis, thrombocytopenic purpura, TEN, and exacerbation of psoriasis. Lenalidomide is approved for myelodysplastic syndromes besides MM, and its use is commonly associ -\nated with a cutaneous eruption (morbilliform, urticarial, dermatitis, acneiform). Other AEs include facial edema, erythema, xerosis, pruritus, folliculitis, skin hyperpigmen -\ntation, hyperhidrosis, and alopecia. Various other derma -\ntologic AEs can occur, albeit at very low rates. A newer analog, pomalidomide, appears to induce similar AEs that, however, are pending characterization.\nCONCLUSIONS\nCancer treatment-related dermatologic AEs bear the po-tential to cause discomfort, impair patients\u2019 quality of life, increase the cost of medical care, and even result in dose modifications\u2014all of which can negatively impact clini -\ncal outcomes. Therefore, it is imperative that clinicians be cognizant of these AEs for their timely recognition, and to initiate appropriate treatment and/or preventive strategies. Dermatologic AEs represent a problem long overlooked and underestimated, and one that requires a multidisci-plinary approach involving oncologists, dermatologists, and nurses, besides effective pharmacovigilance systems.\nSUGGESTED READINGS\nBalagula Y, Lacouture ME, Cotliar JA.

Some diseases are almost always associated with a monoclonal gammopathy (e.g., POEMS syndrome, scleromyxedema), whereas others are frequently associated with a monoclonal gammopathy (e.g., normolipemic plane xanthoma). Many diseases have a greater than chance association with the presence of a se -\nrum or urine monoclonal protein, but this is not required for typical disease expression (e.g., scleredema).\nClinical Manifestations\nPOEMS Syndrome\nThis was recognized as a distinct entity in Japan in \n1968 and is also known as the Crow\u2013Fukase or Takat -\nsuki syndrome. POEMS is an acronym for polyneu-ropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-protein, and skin changes. In a large series men were affected twice as frequently as women, and patients were young \nto middle-aged adults with a mean age of 46  years  \n(compared to mean age of myeloma presentation of \n62 years). All patients had peripheral polyneuropathy  \n(usually sensorimotor), 97% had elevated cerebrospi -\nnal fluid protein, and 62% had papilledema. Organo-megaly was manifested as hepatomegaly in 82% of the patients, lymphadenopathy in 65%, and splenomegaly in 39%. The most common endocrine abnormalities were impotence (78%) and gynecomastia (68%) in men, and amenorrhea (68%) in women.

With advancing age, \ngastrointestinal bleeding leads to severe anemia. Poten -\ntial fatal problems with bleeding warrant close attention.\nElevated transaminases, \u03b3-glutamyl transferase, and \nalkaline phosphatase have been reported in up to 30% of \npatients with HHT. Arteriovenous malformations of the \nliver are likely if there is hepatomegaly or a bruit over the \nliver. Cirrhosis of HHT is described as abnormal dilated \nvessels and changing stroma throughout the liver. Bleed -\ning from hepatic arteriovenous fistulae is rare.\nPulmonary arteriovenous fistulae have been found in \n15% to 33% of patients. Up to 50% of all pulmonary \narteriovenous fistulae are associated with HHT. Cyano -\nsis, clubbing, and dyspnea are late signs of arteriovenous \nfistulae. Most lesions are detected with a combination of \nchest radiography and measurement of PaO 2.\nHigh cardiac output states secondary to severe ane -\nmia and systemic arteriovenous shunting may produce \nbiventricular failure. Multiple arteriovenous fistulas may \npresent with central nervous system findings, including \ntransient ischemic attacks and cerebrovascular accidents. \nCerebrovascular anomalies include arteriovenous malfor -\nmation, capillary angiomas, and telangiectases. It is esti -\nmated that cerebral arteriovenous malformations occur \nin 5% to 10% of patients with HHT. Focal neurologic \ndefects may result from these vascular malformations of \nthe brain, spinal cord, and meninges. Patients with pul -\nmonary and/or cerebral arteriovenous malformations risk \nearly death from rupture of the diseased vessels.\nEvaluation\nThe clinical diagnosis of HHT is based on the presence \nof telangiectases and on a family history of HHT. Four \ncriteria for the diagnosis of HHT include epistaxis, telan -\ngiectases (lips, oral cavity, fingers, nose), visceral lesions, \nand a family history. The diagnosis is definitive with three \nor four criteria, but cannot be established with fewer than \ntwo. HHT lesions occur as multiple, 2- to 4-mm, usually  \nsymmetric, punctate, blanching macules, and as mini -\nmally elevated papules on the lips, face, nasal and oral \nmucosa, hands, feet, and upper extremities. The mode of \ninheritance is autosomal dominant, so a family history of \nbleeding is common.\nIf the characteristic telangiectases are present on the \nskin or mucous membranes, a detailed family history and \nhistory of bleeding episodes are essential. Clinical telan -\ngiectases may be few, especially in children and adoles -\ncents; therefore, close physical examination is necessary. \nRecurrent epistaxis at a young age may precede obvious \ntelangiectases by many years, and this makes family histo -\nry especially important. Examination of family members \nshould focus on the wide spectrum of HHT.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThere are a large number of diseases that can produce \ncutaneous vascular abnormalities. Telangiectatic mats \nwith similar distributions appear in CREST syndrome \n(calcinosis, Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, esophageal dis -\nease, sclerodactyly, and telangiectases) and scleroderma. \nGeneralized essential telangiectasia consists of extensive, sometimes symmetric, sheets of linear telangiectases, \npredominantly on the limbs or trunk. Sunlight and ion -\nizing radiation may produce localized linear telangiecta -\nses in sun-exposed areas. Traumatic lesions are usually \nlinear, or occasionally spider-like and localized. The tel -\nangiectases of acne rosacea are linear, limited to the face \nand nose, and spare mucous membranes. Venous lakes \nare deep blue, soft papules and nodules occurring on the \nlips and ears that blanch only partially on diascopy, are \nusually few in number, and are not associated with mu -\ncosal lesions.\nTreatment\nTreatment should be directed at controlling compli -\ncations of arteriovenous malformations before they  \nbecome symptomatic.

For \nexample, arterial disease should be managed with revas -\ncularization, venous disease with compression, inflamma -\ntory conditions with immunosuppressant medications, and \ninfectious disease with appropriate antimicrobial agents. \nGeneral principles of wound care include appropriate  \ndebridement of devitalized tissue, prompt treatment of \nany supervening wound infection, maintenance of a moist \nand clean healing environment, and compression therapy \nfor leg ulcers not associated with PAD.\nDebridement of Devitalized Tissue\nDebridement is the removal of slough, exudate, eschar, \nbacterial biofilms, and abnormal cells from wound bed \nand edge to permit healing ( Table 46-7 ; Fig. 46-19 ). \nThese elements generally are considered impediments \nto wound healing and most clinicians agree that they \nshould be removed, unless the ulceration is ischemic \n(ischemic tissues tend to desiccate after debridement \nand may be associated with ulcer enlargement) or the \ndiagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum is suspected (due \nto possible pathergy). In theory, debridement converts \na chronic wound to an acute wound and triggers the \nacute wound healing response. It may also directly \nstimulate the underlying granulation tissue by initiat -\ning bleeding.\nManagement of Infection\nAll open wounds are colonized by microorganisms. Sys -\ntemic antibiotic therapy should be used only if a wound \nhas clinical evidence of infection (e.g., cellulitis). Cul -\nture results from either biopsies or wound swabs will in \nmost cases identify the infectious organism and direct \nantibiotic therapy. Empiric therapy is appropriate early \nin the course of care; regimens might include cepha -\nlexin, clindamycin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, and \nfluoroquinolones.\nThe use of antibiotics is not appropriate to treat what \nis grown on wound cultures because these organisms",

On the other hand, past \nmedical history of uncontrolled hypertension could be a \nclue to the diagnosis of Martorell ulcers ( Fig. 46-8 ), and \na history of injections for cosmetic purposes may indicate \na lipogranuloma. Patients may also have factitious or self-\ninflicted ulcerations ( Fig. 46-9 ).\nPhysical Examination\nA focused physical examination could give us clues for di -\nagnosis. For instance, paleness and jaundice in a patient \ncould indicate the coexistence of sickle cell, and the ab -\nsence of pedal pulses indicates arterial insufficiency. Key \nelements of the ulceration that can provide diagnostic  \ninformation are outlined in Table 46-3 . The size of the ulcer \nshould be documented at each visit with photographs and \nby noting dimensions of greatest length and perpendicular \nwidth and depth. Size and depth may be important prognos -\ntically because larger ulcerations are slower to heal. Any un -\ndermining, sinuses, or tunneling must be determined. The \npattern of the ulcerations may also provide important clues. \nCharacteristics of the ulcer base (color, presence of necrosis) can affect healing. The moisture level (dry, moist, or wet) \nand the presence or absence of exudate helps elucidate the \ncause of the ulceration and affect management decisions. \nThe surrounding skin may suggest causes of ulceration (e.g., \nred, hot skin may indicate cellulitis).\nFor all patients with leg ulcers, thorough examination \nof arterial supply is essential. Part of a physical examina -\ntion should include palpation for dorsalis pedis and pos -\nterior tibialis pulses. Screening for arterial insufficiency \nshould be performed in most patients if clinically relevant, \nstarting with the measurement of ABI.

This is im -\nportant in both choosing and interpreting appropriate tests. Abnormal values are not always indicative of im -\nportant disease, or they can be misleading. For example, a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) usually implies a coagulation factor deficiency and would corre -\nlate with a tendency to develop ecchymotic hemorrhage. The finding of lupus anticoagulant can also prolong the PTT, but if it causes disease will result not in simple ec-chymosis but instead in atrophie blanche-like lesions or noninflammatory necrosis or retiform purpura as a result of dermal vessel thrombosis.\nA complete blood cell count and differential can be \nused to assess the number and morphology of platelets, to screen for schistocytes (which suggest a microangiopath -\nic anemia, as may be seen in disseminated intravascular  \ncoagulation), and to explore the likelihood of myelopro -\nliferative disease. A bleeding time is a useful screen of ab -\nnormal platelet function, but a history is usually adequate for diagnosing the most frequent cause of platelet dys -\nfunction, i.e., aspirin use. Reasonable screens for defects in the coagulation cascade system include the PTT and the prothrombin time. More specialized clotting studies, such as protein C and protein S levels, are important in cases of bland occlusion syndromes, but can be falsely low or high in the months following significant occlu -\nsive episodes. Screens for the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome might include a PTT or dilute Russell viper venom test to look for lupus anticoagulant activity, oc -\ncasionally a venereal disease research laboratory test to look for false positives, and anticardiolipin or antiphos -\npholipid antibody tests. Most studies suggest that elevat -\ned IgG anticardiolipin antibodies are more likely to be predictive of or explain thrombosis, but IgM antibodies can occasionally be responsible for thrombotic disease. Unfortunately, IgG or IgM anticardiolipin antibodies have a high rate of false positivity in predicting throm -\nbosis, and may be negative in patients whose thrombosis is due to lupus anticoagulant/antiphospholipid disease. Serum and plasma tubes drawn and spun down at body temperature are essential for excluding cryoglobulin- or cryofibrinogen-related disease. When the clinical picture is appropriate, an antinuclear antibody titer, SS-A and SS-B levels, rheumatoid factor titer, serum protein elec-trophoresis, or immunoelectrophoresis might be indicat-ed. A biopsy of an appropriate lesion early in its evolution is important for the proper diagnosis of palpable purpura, and immunofluorescence studies of early lesions for im-mune complexes are useful if leukocytoclastic vasculitis is suspected. Direct immunofluorescence may be negative, \nespecially if older lesions (greater than 48 to 72  hours old) \nare biopsied. Some lesions of leukocytoclastic vasculitis are negative for direct immunofluorescence in all stages and the pathogenesis of such lesions is unclear. Urinalysis to look for blood, cells, or crystals and testing the stool for occult blood are important to exclude associated or underlying disease, especially in vasculitic syndromes.\nTREATMENT\nTreatment in purpuric syndromes is directed at the spe -\ncific cause of the hemorrhage, so the correct diagnosis is critical to proper care.

The antibody, usually IgM, binds to the red cell in the cold and initiates complement activation; it then elutes at body temperature while the complement activation proceeds to red cell lysis. The cold agglutinin also promotes temperature-dependent agglutination of red cells, leading to sludging or occlu -\nsion of the blood flow in the microvasculature exposed to cold temperatures.\nClinical Manifestations\nCryoglobulinemia\nRoughly 5% to 10% of myeloma proteins and macro -\nglobulins are cryoprecipitable. Type I cryoglobulins \nare usually IgM and therefore primarily intravascular; however, they can also be composed of IgG. To be symptomatic they should precipitate at temperatures easily attained in the cutaneous microvasculature. Such disease may present as Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, livedo reticularis, digital infarcts, peripheral gangrene, or pur -\npura; the latter may be palpable ( Fig. 21-1A  and B ), \nexhibit central necrosis, or have a livedoid or retiform component (Fig. 21-1C ).\nCold sensitivity is more variable with types II and III \ncryoglobulins because these are usually bound to normal IgG. The classification of essential mixed cryoglobuli-nemia is now known to include primarily patients with hepatitis C viral infection. Mixed cryoglobulins may be detected as cryoproteins or as rheumatoid factor in the laboratory; in the patient, they are more likely to cause disease as an immune complex than as a cryogelling pro-tein. For this reason, mixed cryoglobulinemias tend to present with features of leukocytoclastic (necrotizing) vasculitis that affect both small- and medium-sized ves -\nsels in the skin and elsewhere. Palpable purpura, digital infarcts, arthralgias and arthritis, and glomerulonephritis are the usual clinical features. Some patients with an un -\nderlying lymphoproliferative disease may develop angio -\nedema with urticaria as a result of C1 esterase inhibitor depletion; the monoclonal protein in such patients may also behave as a cryoglobulin in the test tube. Finally, some cases of cold-induced urticaria are caused by a cir -\nculating cryoglobulin without evidence of any associated disease.\nB A\nCFIGURE 21-1  n A and B, Palpable purpura in a patient with cryoglobuline-\nmia.

Virtually every organ, \nincluding skin, is affected by inflammatory conditions \n accompanied by tissue hypereosinophilia.\nPATHOGENESIS\nEosinophils circulate transiently in blood (8 to 18 hours) \nand are constantly replenished from bone marrow progeni -\ntor cells. Major growth factors for eosinophils are interleu -\nkin (IL)-5, granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony-stimulating \nfactor (GM-CSF), and IL-3, which are produced and se -\ncreted by activated T cells, mast cells, stromal cells, and \neosinophils themselves. Eosinophils express cell surface \nreceptors for these cytokines throughout development. \nThese cytokines induce not only proliferation of eosino -\nphil progenitor cells, but migration, adherence, cytokine \nproduction, activation, and survival of mature eosinophils. \nThe mobilization of eosinophils from bone marrow into \nblood is regulated predominantly by IL-5 and eotaxin. \n Eosinophils derived from inflamed tissues express higher \nlevels of certain cell surface adhesion receptors.\nSeveral lines of investigation indicate that eosinophils \nare recruited to and activated in tissues by cytokine activ -\nity from the Th2 subset of T cells, which produces IL-4, \nIL-5, IL-10, and IL-13, in addition to cytokines common \nto Th1 cells, such as GM-CSF and IL-3. Eosinophils them -\nselves  elaborate important inflammatory and regulatory \ncytokines. As a result, eosinophil activation occurs in an au -\ntocrine manner. In cytotoxicity assays, eosinophils are maxi -\nmally activated by GM-CSF, followed by IL-3, IL-5, tumor \nnecrosis factor (TNF)- \u03b1, and IL-4, in order of potency.\nUpon activation, eosinophils release granule contents \ninto their extracellular spaces via three mechanisms: \ncytolytic degranulation, piecemeal degranulation, and \nregulated secretion. Cytolytic degranulation is character -\nized by cytoplasmic membrane rupture, chromatolysis of \nnuclei with loss of morphological integrity and identity \nof eosinophils, and extensive deposition of eosinophil \ngranules and granule products within tissue; this process \noccurs in many inflammatory disorders, including skin \ndiseases as well as in affected organs in other diseases. \nThe distinctive eosinophil granule proteins, including \neosinophil major basic protein (eMBP)1, eMBP2, eosin -\nophil-derived neurotoxin, eosinophil cationic protein, \nand eosinophil peroxidase, have many biological activi -\nties (reviewed in detail in other publications) implicating their roles in pathophysiology with effects on tissues and \ncells, including basophils, neutrophils, and platelets, as \nwell as infectious organisms including helminths, RNA \nviruses, and bacteria. Eosinophil granule proteins persist \nin tissues for long periods of time; eMBP1 up to 6 weeks .\nEosinophils possess receptors for glucocorticoids, \nwhich inhibit eosinophil growth and function, and re -\nceptor numbers correlate with responses of eosinophils \nto glucocorticoids.

To help prevent infec -\ntion, acetic-acid-soaked gauze or chlorinated baths can be used. Gauze soaked in 0.25% acetic acid can be ap -\nplied to the skin and left in place for 10 to 15  minutes  \ndaily to reduce bacterial colonization. Alternatively, the patient can soak in a bath with one-quarter cup of household bleach added. Clinicians should have a low threshold for performing blood cultures in patients with a fever and for culturing skin that becomes eroded or yellow-crusted, with subsequent addition of an oral an -\ntibiotic if there are concerns for a secondary infection. Coexistent herpetic infection should also be considered in areas of erosion or in those with an acute onset of pain in a previously pruritic eruption.\nOral therapy with antihistamines can help to relieve \npruritus. Widespread edema may require oral diuresis, which should be used with caution while focusing on the patient\u2019s overall fluid\u2013electrolyte balance. Depending on the underlying disease state, oral corticosteroids may be helpful; however, caution should be utilized as they can worsen erythrodermic psoriasis as well as an infectious process including sepsis. Empiric therapy with a systemic immunosuppressive agent can be considered, but only af -\nter CTCL or other malignancy has been ruled out. If the exact etiology of erythroderma is not well understood and systemic therapy is necessary, oral methotrexate or oral retinoids such as acitretin are reasonable options, and ther -\napies such as tumor necrosis factor inhibitors should be avoided to prevent exacerbation of a potential smoldering malignancy. After initial erythroderma is under control, phototherapy also can be considered, but often burns and \ncan worsen skin disease in acute  erythroderma.\nThe prognosis of erythroderma depends on the under -\nlying cause. Erythroderma secondary to a drug reaction can resolve within several weeks, given that the offending agent has been removed. Psoriasis and atopic dermatitis can improve with proper treatment over weeks to months. Erythroderma secondary to CTCL or other malignancy tends to be refractory to standard treatment and can prog -\nress quickly with a higher morbidity and mortality. The mortality rate in erythroderma has been reported to be between 11% and 64%, depending on the underlying eti -\nology, but is highest in patients with malignancy-related erythroderma, in individuals who develop high-output cardiac failure, or in those with sepsis.\nSUGGESTED READINGS\nCallen JP, Bernardi D M, Clark R A, Weber D A.

In the desmoglein compensation hypothesis, binding of IgG to desmoglein molecules structurally disrupts epidermal cell adhesion. Desmoglein 1 (Dsg 1)  \nexpression is very low in mucosa, but it is expressed throughout the skin and increases in the more superficial layers. Desmoglein 3 (Dsg 3), by contrast, is expressed in all levels of mucosa, but only in and near the basal layer of the skin. Therefore, pemphigus foliaceus with Dsg 1  \nantibodies leads to superficial blistering in the skin, but no oral involvement. Pemphigus vulgaris with only Dsg 3 antibodies (mucosal-dominant pemphigus vulgaris) leads to oral erosions but minimal skin blisters. Amagai has proposed the \u201cdesmoglein compensation theory\u201d as an explanation of this phenomenon, suggesting that Dsg 1 in the skin can \u201ccompensate\u201d for the loss of Dsg 3 adhe -\nsion in this form of the disease. Finally, there can be no desmoglein compensation in pemphigus with both Dsg 1 and 3 antibodies (mucocutaneous pemphigus vulgaris), so acantholysis results in both skin and mucosa. Comple-ment activation is not thought to play a role in acantholy -\nsis. The second hypothesis involves binding of IgG to the desmoglein cell surface antigen. This triggers transmem -\nbrane signaling and a series of intracellular pathways that lead to separation of the epidermal cells. These pathways are complex, but the validity of the process has been doc -\numented in  vitro.\nAlthough the stimulus for pemphigus antibody for -\nmation is unknown, the endemic nature of pemphigus foliaceus in Brazil suggests the involvement of an envi -\nronmental factor, possibly an infectious agent. Most of the cases in Brazil occur in populations residing near riv -\ners, and an insect vector for a microorganism has been proposed. Whether pemphigus in other geographic areas is precipitated by similar events is unknown. \nD-\nPenicillamine may produce pemphigus (predominantly pemphigus foliaceus) in patients being treated for rheu -\nmatoid arthritis, Wilson\u2019s disease, scleroderma, or other penicillamine-responsive disorders. Consequently, it is likely that a variety of stimuli may give rise to epidermal antigen intolerance.\nThere is a strong association of pemphigus vul -\ngaris with the HLA class II alleles HLA DRB*0402, DRB*0401, and DQB1*0503. These HLA alleles may restrict autoreactive responses to desmoglein 3.\nClassification\nThere are two histopathologically distinct forms of pem-phigus. Pemphigus vulgaris is the most severe type and is characterized histopathologically by suprabasilar cleft formation, whereas pemphigus foliaceus is less severe and is distinguished by blister formation within or just be -\nneath the granular layer. In pemphigus vulgaris and, to a lesser extent, pemphigus foliaceus, the blister may extend into surrounding nonblistered skin by applying shearing pressure to perilesional tissue (Nikolsky\u2019s sign).\nPemphigus vulgaris is the most common form of pem -\nphigus and is generally seen in the fourth to sixth decades of life. It has, however, been described both in children and in the elderly. Prior to the use of corticosteroids, 50% of patients with the disease died within the first \n12 months, most frequently from secondary cachexia, \nsepsis, and/or electrolyte imbalance. Now, with the broad utilization of immunosuppressants, the mortality is 5%.\nPemphigus vegetans is a rare variant of pemphigus \nvulgaris.",

There is no correlation between macrocephaly and \nimpaired intellectual performance, seizures, or electro -\nencephalographic abnormalities.\nMusculoskeletal Disorders\nSphenoid wing dysplasia is a distinctive osteopathy of \nneurofibromatosis. It presents as a unilateral defect  \naffecting the orbital plate and frontal bone. Dysplasia of \na long bone occurs in nearly 14% of patients with neuro -\nfibromatosis and usually presents in the first year of life. \nThe most commonly affected bone is the tibia, which will \nbow in an anterolateral direction. Repeated fracture and \nfailure to heal can result in a pseudoarthrosis, which is \na false joint. Scoliosis has been reported to occur in up \nto 10% of patients with neurofibromatosis and usually  \nbecomes apparent by age 10 years. Dystrophic scoliosis \nis a rapidly progressive form with the potential to cause a  \nvariety of neurologic complications. Radiographic bone \nabnormalities may also result from pressure by intraosse -\nous or paraosseous neurofibromas. No consensus on treat -\nment is available and severe cases have led to amputation. \nShort stature is also another feature more prominent in \nindividuals with neurofibromatosis. Growth curves com -\nparing nonaffected and affected children show similar \ngrowth profiles until preadolescence at which point the \ngrowth rate for children with neurofibromatosis decreas -\nes significantly. In addition, they are at increased risk of \nosteoporosis and osteopenia later in life.\nVascular Disorders\nHypertension is more prevalent in patients with NF1 \nand can develop at any age. The hypertension is usually \nessential, but may occur secondary to renal artery ste -\nnosis, coarctation of the aorta, or pheochromocytoma. \nVasculopathy may involve arteries of the heart and brain. \nCongenital heart defects and valvar pulmonic stenosis are \nmore common in individuals with neurofibromatosis.\nGastrointestinal Disorders\nVisceral tumors arise from intra-abdominal neural tis -\nsue and include neurofibromas, leiomyomas, and miscel -\nlaneous tumors. The most common complications are \nobstruction, intussusception, and hemorrhage caused by \nerosions or necrosis of pedunculated tumors. Persistent \nconstipation occurs in 10% of cases and is due to disor -\nganization of the tunica muscularis and Auerbach\u2019s plexus \nof the colon.\nEndocrine Disorders\nAberrant endocrine function is not a regular finding in \nneurofibromatosis and although frequently mentioned is \nprobably present in less than 1% of cases. Pheochromo -\ncytoma, often benign and unilateral, is the most common endocrine abnormality. It predominantly produces nor -\nepinephrine. Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid and \nhyperparathyroidism are even less common. In addition, \nit has been reported that optic gliomas in children with \nhypothalamic involvement may present with either pre -\nmature or delayed puberty.\nMiscellaneous Disorders\nMiscellaneous malignancies, including Wilms\u2019 tumor, \nrhabdomyosarcoma, and leukemia, and a variety of  \ntumors of neural crest origin, including malignant mela -\nnomas, are more common in patients with neurofibro -\nmatosis than in the population at large.

Most  common in middle-\naged women, this is a diffuse, chronic, fluctuating form of \nhair loss that affects the entire scalp. Sometimes confused \nwith androgenetic alopecia, chronic telogen effluvium \nmay cause diffuse thinning and bitemporal recession, but \nsevere and obvious balding is rare. Notably, chronic telo -\ngen effluvium is a diagnosis of exclusion rather than being \nlinked to an identifiable underlying etiology.\nDiagnosis and Treatment\nThe distinctive history of abrupt onset, diffuse hair shed -\nding and an identifiable inciting event make telogen ef -\nfluvium a straightforward clinical diagnosis. Despite this, \nandrogenetic alopecia  and diffuse alopecia areata should \nbe considered in the differential diagnosis. Patients with \ntelogen effluvium often describe loss of the most hair \nwhen showering in addition to finding hairs on clothing, \non the bathroom floor, and in their vehicles.

Thyroid peroxidase antibodies are seen in 40% of \npatients with DH. The abnormal findings are especially prominent in females, and some thyroid abnormality may occur in as many as 40% of female DH patients.\nLymphoma is known to occur with increased preva -\nlence in patients with gluten-sensitive enteropathy. There are many case reports of abdominal lymphoma in patients with DH, but the only controlled study of this phenomenon was performed by Leonard and suggested a slight increase in the incidence of lymphoma (4%) in patients with DH. It was suggested that this incidence may be reduced by a gluten-free diet, although at pres-ent there are insufficient data to support this conclusion. An extremely large study would be necessary to evaluate the statistical validity of the association between DH and lymphoma. Consequently, it is best to assume that the incidence is approximately that of celiac disease, and ap -\npropriate evaluation should be performed if signs of lym -\nphoma develop.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThe differential diagnoses are those of subepidermal blistering disease, reviewed under the heading of bullous pemphigoid. The main clinical differentiation is with lin -\near IgA disease. Direct immunofluorescence is essential to distinguish between linear IgA disease and DH. Also helpful in differentiating the two is the fact that DH is closely associated with HLA-B8-DR3, whereas linear IgA disease has no HLA associations and does not respond to a gluten-free diet.\nPatient Evaluation\nImmunofluorescence is essential in diagnosis. Nonin -\nflamed perilesional skin harbors the greatest amount of IgA and is therefore the preferred biopsy site for direct immunofluorescence when DH is suspected. IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies are found in the serum of DH patients as well as those with celiac disease, and are an indication of gluten sensitivity. However, serum anti-body tests should not be used for diagnosis in the absence of direct immunofluorescence.\nClose clinical examination for thyroid nodules and \nthyromegaly is indicated as a baseline and at return visits. Detailed history of bowel symptoms, including bloating after eating, recurrent abdominal pain, diarrhea, and ste-atorrhea, is indicated. Patients who do not have obvious signs of gluten-sensitive enteropathy may frequently note improvement in these minimal symptoms when a gluten-free diet is instituted.\nA CBC, chemistry profile, and urinalysis are neces -\nsary as baseline studies in all patients with DH. This ap -\nproach not only screens for the malabsorption problems discussed previously, but also represents a baseline for subsequent abnormalities that may be induced by dap-sone therapy. Serum thyroxine and thyrotropin hormone levels are evaluated as a baseline in view of the high in -\ncidence of thyroid abnormalities. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase levels should be checked as a baseline in patients who are black or of southern Mediterranean origin, as catastrophic hemolysis may result from the ad -\nministration of dapsone in deficient patients. Evaluation for associated malabsorption is reviewed in Chapter 25.\nTreatment\nDapsone is the drug of choice in the therapy of DH. Treatment with dapsone will adequately suppress (but not cure) the disease. Dapsone treatment requires con-tinued monitoring and may be associated with signifi -\ncant side effects. Dapsone is available in 25- and 100-\nmg tablets. Initial treatment with 25  mg of dapsone  \nby mouth daily usually improves symptoms within 24 \nto 48  hours in adults. Correspondingly smaller doses  \nshould be used in children. When taken daily, dapsone \nlevels reach a steady state within 7  days. Maintenance  \ntherapy is then adjusted on a weekly basis to maintain adequate suppression of symptoms; the average main -\ntenance dose is 100  mg daily (range 1 to 3  mg/kg/day).  \nOccasional new lesions (two or three per week) are to be expected and are not an indication for altering daily dosage. Minor fluctuations in disease severity do occur and are probably related to oral gluten intake. Applica -\ntion of potent topical corticosteroid gel may be helpful in relieving symptoms of individual lesions. Hemolysis is the most common side effect of treatment. Dapsone is a strong oxidizer and produces a dose-related oxidant stress on normal aging red blood cells.",

Frequently, there are multiple HPV types \npresent in single skin biopsies. Typically, the prevalence \nof viral warts rises steadily after transplantation and a \nstrong association exists between the number of HPV-\ninduced warts and the development of skin cancer. The \nhair follicle region might be the reservoir of EV-HPV. \nThe E6 protein from a range of cutaneous HPV types \neffectively inhibits apoptosis in response to UV light-\ninduced damage. It is therefore conceivable that indi -\nviduals who are infected by EV-HPV are at an increased \nrisk of developing actinic keratoses and squamous cell \ncarcinomas, possibly by chronically preventing UV \nlight-induced apoptosis.\nThe frequency of total body skin examinations is  \ndetermined according to the degree and duration of  \nimmunosuppression, type of organ transplant received, \nskin pigmentation, amount of cumulative sun exposure,  \npresence or absence of condylomata acuminata, and num -\nber of previous actinic keratoses and nonmelanoma skin \ncancers. At one end of the spectrum are those individu -\nals who develop multiple tumors every few months, and \nin this group reduction of immunosuppression as well as \nprophylactic therapies such as oral retinoids need to be \nconsidered. Acitretin has been shown to reduce the num -\nber of new SCCs that develop in transplant patients, but \na rebound effect occurs if the medication is discontinued. \nThe side effects of the oral retinoids, e.g., birth defects, \nhypertriglyceridemia, must of course be weighed against \nthe benefits.\nPrompt diagnosis and treatment of cutaneous SCCs \nis indicated in transplant patients, given the aggressive \nnature of these tumors. Therapeutic options include \nelectrodesiccation and curettage for in situ lesions,  \nroutine surgical excision, microscopically controlled \nexcision (Mohs\u2019 technique) for large, rapidly grow -\ning, ill-defined or recurrent lesions, and, occasionally, \npostoperative adjuvant radiation therapy (e.g., if there \nis neurotropism). Topical 5-fluorouracil or imiquimod \nand photodynamic therapy have been used in individu -\nals with numerous AKs and significant actinic dam -\nage. In solid organ transplant recipients who contin -\nue to develop multiple NMSCs, immunosuppression \nwith sirolimus (rapamycin), rather than cyclosporine \nor tacrolimus, or minimization of immunosuppres -\nsion in consultation with the transplant team can be \nconsidered.\nMiscellaneous\nFollicular dystrophy of immunosuppression (trichodys -\nplasia spinulosa) is an entity that has been described over \nthe past decade in patients (including transplant recipi -\nents) who are immunocompromised. Various theories \nhave been proposed with regard to etiology, from be -\ning virally induced (\u201cviral-associated trichodysplasia of \nimmunosuppression\u201d) to a side effect of cyclosporine \n(\u201ccyclosporine-induced follicular dystrophy\u201d). Patients develop follicular papules, especially on the central face, \nas well as loss of the eyebrows and eyelashes.\nGRAFT-VERSUS-HOST DISEASE\nGraft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is the most common \ncause of morbidity and mortality in allogeneic hema -\ntopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. It is caused by \nan immunologic reaction of immunocompetent donor  \nT lymphocytes in a recipient who is incapable of reject -\ning the graft. T-cell depletion of the allograft reduces the \nrisk of GVHD but is associated with a higher incidence \nof tumor recurrence and graft failure. The reason for the \nhigher risk of recurrence is the lack of a graft-versus-\ntumor effect. As a result, most transplants are still car -\nried out with unmodified (i.e., T-cell replete) grafts and \nare associated with a significant risk of acute and chronic \nGVHD.",

Because of limited sensitivity and specificity, \nthese tests should be performed more than once, and \ntheir results should be concordant.\nAfter the presence of hypercortisolism is confirmed, \nadditional testing must be performed to determine the \ncause. Most cases of endogenous hypercortisolism are \nthe result of excessive secretion of ACTH by a pituitary \ntumor. Other causes include adrenal tumors (which \nare ACTH-independent) and ACTH production from \nnonpituitary tumors, the most common of which are \noat cell carcinoma of the lung, carcinoid, gastrinoma, \nmalignant thymoma, pheochromocytoma, and medul -\nlary carcinoma of the thyroid. The treatment of hyper -\ncortisolism depends on the detection and correction of \nthe underlying cause, such as surgical resection of a \ncausative tumor.\nInsufficient Glucocorticoid Activity \n(Addison Disease)\nAdrenal insufficiency may result from a number of pro -\ncesses that cause extensive destruction or dysfunction of \nthe adrenal cortices. Prolonged administration of synthetic \nglucocorticoids with subsequent discontinuation is by far \nthe most common cause of adrenal insufficiency. Other \nmajor causes include autoimmune adrenalitis (more com -\nmon in women), infections (primarily tuberculosis and \ndeep fungal infections), and metastatic disease. Less com -\nmon causes include drugs and hemorrhage. The systemic \nantifungal medication ketoconazole inhibits steroidogen -\nesis but only rarely causes clinical hypocortisolism. Other \nmedications that inhibit cortisol biosynthesis include the \nantiepileptic drug aminoglutethimide, the anesthetic seda -\ntive drug etomidate, and the antiparasitic drug suramin.The clinical manifestations of Addison\u2019s are diverse. \nConstitutional symptoms include malaise, reduced energy, \nweight loss, and a feeling of ill health. Other systemic \nmanifestations are hypotension, weakness, fatigue, gas -\ntrointestinal symptoms (anorexia, nausea, and abdominal \npain), and psychiatric symptoms. Adrenal crisis (acute \nadrenal insufficiency) may result in life-threatening hy -\npotension and shock.\nThe primary dermatologic manifestation is hyper -\npigmentation of the skin and mucous membranes ( Fig. \n27-2). The hyperpigmentation of adrenal insufficiency \nis the most characteristic physical finding of the disease \nand may precede other symptoms by months or years. \nSkin darkening is induced by high levels of ACTH and  \nmelanocyte-stimulating hormone, which share the pro -\nhormone pro-opiomelanocortin in common. For this \nreason, hyperpigmentation does not occur in those with \npituitary failure but is, rather, limited to those with pri -\nmary adrenal failure. Because adrenal insufficiency often \nhas an insidious onset, the hyperpigmentation may go un -\nnoticed by the patient. Commonly involved areas include \nthose which are sun-exposed; those exposed to friction or \npressure such as the knuckles, elbows, and knees; scars; \nand naturally hyperpigmented sites such as the axillae, \nperineum, and nipples. Darkening of the palmar creases \nis considered nearly specific for adrenal insufficiency in \nlight-skinned patients. Pigmentation of the tongue, lips, \nand buccal mucosa is another useful sign. The hair may \nbecome darker, and pigmented longitudinal bands may \ndevelop on the nails. New nevi can appear, and old nevi \ndarken.\nAdrenal insufficiency is associated with other skin \nmanifestations as a part of polyglandular autoimmune \nsyndrome type I (chronic mucocutaneous candidia -\nsis) and type II (vitiligo). A rare manifestation of adre -\nnal insufficiency is fibrosis and calcification of the ear \ncartilage.\nThe laboratory abnormalities seen in adrenal in -\nsufficiency include hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. \nScreening for adrenal insufficiency includes two tests: \nbasal plasma ACTH level and cortisol level 30 to \n60 minutes following ACTH (cosyntropin) stimula -\ntion test. Primary adrenal insufficiency manifests with \nhigh basal ACTH combined with a blunted cortisol re -\nsponse to the ACTH stimulation test.",

Through cell motility, they in-\nvade lymphatics or vasculature while evading apoptosis, attach to and invade target tissues through matrix degra -\ndation, and proliferate. Chemokine expression by tumor cells has been implicated in organ-specific metastases. Melanomas can express the chemokine CCL27, which is site-specific for skin and could explain the high inci -\ndence of cutaneous metastases in this cancer. Other fac -\ntors may be related to locations for metastases as well. In one study, the face and scalp were involved preferentially in distant metastases, possibly secondary to the high vas -\ncularization of these sites.\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\nSite\nInternal malignancies can directly invade surrounding \ntissues or metastasize locally or to distant sites. Direct invasion is most commonly seen with breast, followed by oral cavity cancer. Most skin metastases are local, within the anatomic vicinity of the primary malignancy, and not infrequently involve scars of surgical excisions. The chest is the most common site, followed by the abdomen. The high incidence of breast and lung cu -\ntaneous metastases account for the chest involvement, and bowel, ovary, and bladder cancers often involve the abdomen. The marked predominance of cutane -\nous metastases from breast cancer may also be related to the proximity of breast tumors to the skin. Although distant metastases are less common, they are seen with melanoma, lung and breast cancers, and may occur with most types of malignancy. The scalp is a frequent site, occurring in 6.9% of patients with distant metastases, regardless of histologic subtype. Renal cell carcinoma in particular is disproportionately associated with scalp me-tastases. Sister Mary Joseph\u2019s nodule is a well-described metastasis to the umbilicus, most commonly of gastric origin, but is a rare phenomenon. The extremities are unusual locations for cutaneous metastases, but are most frequently seen with melanoma.\nAppearance\nCutaneous metastases most commonly have a nonspecific appearance, and are frequently described as asymptom -\natic, skin colored to erythematous or violaceous, dermal nodules. These are usually multiple but can also be soli -\ntary. In one study, solitary nodules were most commonly seen with metastatic lung cancer, followed by unknown primary malignancy. Metastatic renal cell carcinoma in particular has been described as presenting with viola-ceous or \u201cvascular\u201d nodules (see Fig. 19-1). Metastatic \nmelanoma is often described as pigmented nodules, but is presented in this way only in 36% of cases in one study.

Onset of cutaneous lesions occurs pri -\nor to the third trimester in 75%, and one-third of patients \nrecall similar eruption in previous pregnancies. There is no \nassociation with parity or gestation. AD presents most com -\nmonly with pruritic, erythematous scaling patches affecting \nthe face, neck, flexures of the extremities, and trunk. Less \ncommon manifestations include follicular truncal eczema, \npapular eczema, and dyshidrosis.

Recurrence \nwith subsequent pregnancy is common.\nAutoimmune Progesterone Dermatitis\nAutoimmune progesterone dermatitis (APD) is a rare, \npoorly characterized, cyclical pruritic eruption believed \nto be related to fluctuations in serum progesterone levels. \nAPD is caused by hypersensitivity to progesterone, endog -\nenous or exogenous, and progesterone autoantibodies are \ninvolved in pathogenesis. The heterogeneous clinical pre -\nsentation includes features of urticaria, eczema, erythema \nmultiforme, or vesiculobullous eruption posing consider -\nable diagnostic challenge. Oral stomatitis and aphthous ul -\ncers may occur. Anaphylaxis is rare. Catamenial flares 3 to \n10 days prior to menses and subsequent resolution within \na few days of menstruation are typical. Diagnosis hinges \non the presence of cyclical premenstrual flares, reproduc -\nibility of cutaneous eruption upon intramuscular challenge \nwith progesterone, and response to inhibition of ovulation. \nRare cases of new-onset, spontaneous resolution and wors -\nening of APD have each been reported in pregnancy.\nImpetigo Herpetiformis\nImpetigo herpetiformis (IH, pustular psoriasis of preg -\nnancy) represents an acute pustular phase of psoriasis \nprecipitated by endocrinologic changes in pregnancy; \nsome debate whether IH is a rare form of generalized \npustular psoriasis unique to pregnancy. Pathogenesis re -\nmains unclear but is believed to relate to high levels of \nprogesterone seen late in pregnancy and low serum levels of calcium. IH has also been reported in the setting of \nhypoparathyroidism or status post-thyroidectomy.\nIH most frequently develops in the third trimester  \nbut has been reported at any stage of gestation and post -\npartum. There is no association with either parity or \n gestation. Although familial clustering has been reported, \npersonal or family history of psoriasis is often absent.\nEpidermal, pinhead-sized, pustules are arranged in \ngroups or concentric rings at the periphery of erythema -\ntous, sometimes polycyclic, plaques.

The skin rash manifests \nfrom discrete crops of pustules to widespread pustulo -\nsis (Fig. 8-3 ). Ichthyosis and nail changes such as ony -\nchomadesis and pitting have also been reported.

About one-third of all patients with der -\nmatitis herpetiformis have either clinical thyroid disease \nor abnormal thyroid function test results.

Both myxedema and thyrotoxicosis \nhave been reported with pseudoxanthoma elasticum. \nHyperthyroidism and psoriasis may also be statistically \nassociated.\nFinally, it should be noted that pruritus may be severe \nin up to 5% of patients with Graves\u2019 disease, especially \nthose with attendant chronic idiopathic urticaria associat -\ned with thyroid autoantibodies. Indeed, 12.1% of chronic \nurticaria patients had increased antithyroid microsomal \nantibodies; meta-analysis showed patients with urticaria \nwere more likely to have thyroid autoimmunity than con -\ntrols.

By definition, these lesions are asso -\nciated with paraproteinemia, most commonly an IgG kappa monoclonal gammopathy, and infrequently with myeloma.\nPaget\u2019s Disease of the Breast and \nExtramammary Paget\u2019s Disease\nPaget\u2019s disease of the breast is characterized by an ery -\nthematous, eczematous plaque surrounding the nip -\nple and areola. This condition occurs in conjunction \nwith a ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast, which has frequently metastasized to the axillary lymph nodes. Paget\u2019s disease is believed to be caused by an upward migration of malignant cells, and hence it is not truly a paraneoplastic sign but rather a specific malignant infiltrate.\nExtramammary Paget\u2019s disease is the same clinico-\npathologic lesion as that found in Paget\u2019s disease of the breast, but on a nonmammary surface, most often the genital, axillary, or perianal skin ( Fig. 17-8). Roughly \n30% to 50% of patients with this condition have an un -\nderlying neoplasm, which generally underlies the area of skin involvement, most commonly of the genitourinary or gastrointestinal tract. In patients with extramammary Paget\u2019s disease, an evaluation of the areas contiguous to the disease should be undertaken.\nPityriasis Rotunda\nPityriasis rotunda is an unusual, round, noninflamma -\ntory lesion that occurs on the trunk and results in hyper -\npigmentation. Various malignancies have been reported to occur in conjunction with pityriasis rotunda. The condition has also been reported with numerous other potential etiologic agents. In a study from South Africa, 7 of 10 patients with pityriasis rotunda had hepatocellu -\nlar carcinoma. The relationship of this cutaneous condi -\ntion to malignancy when present is not known. To date, there have not been reports of patients whose pityriasis rotunda has followed the course of their neoplasm. De -\nspite the lack of confirmatory data, it seems prudent to at least consider cancer in anyone with this rare cutaneous disease.\nPunctate Keratoses and Arsenical \nKeratoses of the Palms and Soles\nPunctate keratoses are discrete, skin-colored, hyperker-\natotic papules that occur on the palms and soles, most commonly in African-Americans. The lesions often have a central plug or a depressed, crater-like center. They are often numerous, but remain distinct from one an-other. Symptoms are uncommon. Arsenical keratoses, albeit histopathologically distinct, may be clinically in -\ndistinguishable from punctate keratoses. Although the relationship between punctate keratoses and malignancy is controversial at best, chronic arsenic exposure in con -\ntaminated drinking water has been associated with blad -\nder and lung carcinoma in addition to nonmelanoma skin cancer.\nPyoderma Gangrenosum and Other \n\u201cNeutrophilic\u201d Dermatoses\nCases of various malignancies have been reported in -\nfrequently in patients with classic pyoderma gangreno -\nsum.

Similarly, many patients with Sweet\u2019s syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermato -\nsis) have been reported to have myeloid leukemia ( Fig. \n17-9). Paraneoplastic neutrophilic lesions on the face may simulate erysipelas. In patients with malignancy-associated neutrophilic dermatoses, the discovery of the leukemia often occurs simultaneously with the rec -\nognition of the cutaneous abnormality.

Two or more of the following criteria are needed:  \n 1.  Six or more caf\u00e9-au-lait spots greater than 1.5 cm in \nadults and 0.5 cm in prepubertal children.\n 2.  Two or more neurofibromas of any type or one plexi -\nform neurofibroma.\n 3.  Axillary or inguinal freckling.\n 4.  Optic glioma.\n 5.  Two or more Lisch nodules.\n 6.

A first-degree relative with NF1.  \nThese diagnostic criteria are both highly sensitive and \nspecific for adults with neurofibromatosis. They are less \nsensitive in children, especially those under 8 years of age, \nbecause some of the criteria do not manifest at a young \nage. Other minor features that may assist in the diagnosis \ninclude macrocephaly, hypertelorism, short stature, and \nthorax abnormalities.\nLegius syndrome (OMIM #611431), an autosomal \ndominant NF1-like disorder, is a genetically distinct \ndisorder with a similar phenotype to NF1. It results \nfrom germline loss-of-function mutations in SPRED1. \nThe SPRED1 gene encodes a negative regulator of the \nRAS-MAPK pathway, similar to neurofibromin. This \ndisorder is characterized by multiple CALMs, axil -\nlary freckling, and macrocephaly. These individuals do \nnot have neurofibromas, Lisch nodules, or NF1 gene \nabnormalities.\nPatient Evaluation\nGiven the myriad of clinical features in neurofibroma -\ntosis, the utility of extensive screening tests remains \ncontroversial. In general, clinical evaluation tends \nto be more helpful to detect complications than are \nscreening investigations in asymptomatic patients.  \nAnnual visits should include a thorough physical exam,",

This discussion includes cutaneous asso -\nciations of the following disorders: gastrointestinal hem -\norrhage, polyposis, malabsorption, inflammatory bowel \ndisease, and pancreatic disease. The genetic basis of many \nof these diseases has now been elucidated ( Table 29-1 ).\nGASTROINTESTINAL HEMORRHAGE\nExtensive gastrointestinal hemorrhage may occasionally \nbe related to systemic disorders that are easily recog -\nnized by their cutaneous findings. Pseudoxanthoma elas -\nticum and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia will be \ndiscussed.\nPseudoxanthoma Elasticum\nPseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a rare inherited dis -\norder of elastic tissue that occurs in 1: 25,000\u2013100,000 \nbirths. There is progressive calcification of tissue rich in \nelastin fibers, including the skin, retina, and blood vessels. There is significant heterogeneity in the age of onset as \nwell as the severity of organ system involvement. The \ngreatest morbidity lies in reduced vision from macular \nhemorrhage and scarring of the macula. Affected indi -\nviduals have a normal lifespan.\nPathogenesis\nPXE is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. PXE \nis caused by mutation in the ABCC6  gene, ATP-binding \ncassette transporter protein. The gene has been mapped \nto chromosome 16p13.1. At least one ABCC6  mutation \ncan be found in 80% of affected individuals. ABCC6 \nprotein is largely expressed in the liver and kidney. The \nABCC6  gene encodes for a cellular transport protein, \ngiving rise to the concept that PXE may be a systemic \nmetabolic disorder rather than purely a structural disor -\nder of connective tissue. The elastic fibers are abnormal \nin the affected tissues. Changes include fragmentation \nand calcification of degenerated elastic tissue fibers in the \nmiddle and deep reticular dermis. Progressive accumula -\ntion of calcium within the elastic fibers leads to fracture \nand destruction.\nPresentation\nCutaneous findings usually begin in the second to third \ndecades. Calcification of elastic fibers results in yellowish \ndiscoloration of the skin. Affected skin reveals progres -\nsive yellowish coalescent papules on the lateral aspect of \nthe neck, the flexural creases of the antecubital fossa and \npopliteal fossa, the axilla, and the groin. These yellow \npapules have been described as having a \u201cplucked chicken \nskin\u201d appearance. In severe cases, the skin appears loose \nand wrinkled ( Figs 29-1 and 29-2 ).\nThe earliest ocular finding is diffuse mottling of the \nfundus. In the second to third decade, angioid streaks de -\nvelop in the eye. These present as linear and branching \nnetworks of grayish discoloration radiating from the op -\ntic disc. Angioid streaks are larger in caliber than blood \nvessels and represent choroidal neovascularization in the \nelastic lamina of Bruch\u2019s membrane of the retina. Angioid \nstreaks do not affect visual acuity. Subretinal neovascu -\nlarization and hemorrhage lead to scarring and loss of vi -\nsion.

Sunitinib may be associated with pigmentary disorders and facial edema.\nBevacizumab is a chimeric mouse-human mAb that \nbinds to circulating VEGF, thus preventing its bind -\ning to the VEGFR. It is approved in the treatment of mCRC, nonsquamous NSCLC, metastatic breast cancer, and glioblastoma. Although it interferes with the VEGF/VEGFR pathway, the resultant dermatologic AE profile is dissimilar to that of small molecule VEGFR inhibitors (e.g., sorafenib, sunitinib). Bevacizumab mainly causes pruritus and nonspecific cutaneous eruptions, but notably it interferes with wound healing and can induce sponta-neous ulcerations, particularly in damaged sites such as striae. Therefore, it is recommended that invasive surger-\nies and/or procedures be scheduled at least 5  weeks after \ndiscontinuing the drug. In a small case series, the occur-rence of geographic tongue has been reported ( Gavrilovic \net al., 2012 ).\nBRAF Inhibitors\nVemurafenib and dabrafenib are selective inhibitors \ntargeting activating mutations of the BRAF oncogene. \n Vemurafenib has been approved for the treatment of \nunresectable or metastatic melanoma harboring the  \nV600EBRAF mutation.

The incidence of all-grade dermatologic eruptions has been estimated to be 27.3%, with the most common presentation being an eruption comprising erythematous papules and pustules (\nBalagula et  al., 2012; Ramirez-Fort \net al., 2014; Shameem et  al., 2015 ). Management is symp-\ntomatic, with topical and systemic analgesics/corticosteroids forming the crux. Stomatitis is another well-recognized and common dermatologic AE that is amenable to treatment with topical corticosteroids.

The main prob -\nlem is that in the lymph nodes the diffuse type of FCL is recognized and managed as a high-grade lymphoma, whereas in the skin it represents a morphologic variant of a low-grade CBCL. Thus, patients with the diffuse type of cFCL have been often treated with unnecessarily ag -\ngressive options. Once again, cFCL should be managed in a conservative way regardless of the histopathologic pattern, and systemic chemotherapy is required only in rare patients (those with extracutaneous dissemination). In this context, staging investigations are paramount to plan the proper treatment for any given patient, in  \norder to rule out that the skin lesions represent a second -\nary manifestation of a nodal lymphoma.\nCutaneous Marginal Zone Lymphoma (cMZL)\nCutaneous cases of MZL have been lumped together with \nmucosal cases in the WHO classification, and are includ -\ned in the group of extranodal MZL of the MALT. This group of lymphomas is characterized by several common features, particularly the association with chronic inflam-mation due to autoimmune disorders or infections. On the other hand, it is yet unclear whether lumping all of these entities in a single group is appropriate in terms of management of the individual patients.\ncMZL occurs typically in young adults with a male \npredominance, but children may be affected as well (it represents one of the most frequent types of childhood cutaneous lymphoma after MF). Patients present with red to reddish brown papules, plaques, and nodules local -\nized particularly to the upper extremities or the trunk. In the absence of extracutaneous symptoms, the need for complete staging investigations in patients with cMZL is questionable. The prognosis is excellent, and patients should be managed in a nonaggressive way (surgical exci -\nsion suffices in most cases). As already mentioned, anti -\nbiotic treatment aimed at eradication of Borrelia infection \nshould be carried out in patients proven to have Borrelia.\nCutaneous Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma, \nLeg-type (cDLBCL-LT)\nThis type of cutaneous lymphoma is morphological -\nly, phenotypically, and genetically comparable to dif -\nfuse large B-cell lymphomas arising at extracutaneous \nsites, and is characterized by an aggressive course with a disease-specific 5-year survival of <50%. The disease predominantly affects the leg(s) of elderly patients (over \n70 years of age), especially females. Complete staging in -\nvestigations are mandatory, and anthracycline-containing systemic chemotherapy combined with rituximab repre -\nsents the treatment of choice. Age may be a limiting fac-tor for aggressive treatment options, and radiotherapy represents a second option. As already mentioned, differ -\nentiation of cDLBCL-LT from cFCL with diffuse pat-tern of growth is paramount, as treatment and prognosis are completely different. Differential diagnostic criteria have been outlined in the paragraph on cFCL earlier in this chapter. For practical purposes, a diagnosis of \u201cpri -\nmary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma\u201d arising on the back should be reevaluated by a center with special expertise in cutaneous lymphomas. At the same time, it must be clearly understood that the skin may be the site of secondary involvement by extracutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, thus complete staging investigations are mandatory in order to plan properly the management of each patient.\nBlastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell \nNeoplasm\nBlastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) \nis an aggressive hematologic disorder deriving from in-terferon-producing plasmacytoid dendritic cells type I (\u201cplasmacytoid monocytes\u201d). Many patients present at onset with disease limited to the skin (i.e., staging inves -\ntigations may be negative), but they should be treated similarly to those with systemic involvement. A similar situation may be observed in patients with acute myelog -\nenous leukemia and is referred to as \u201caleukemic leukemia cutis.\u201d In fact, BPDCN and myelogenous leukemia are strictly related.",

Systemically, \nthey include hypertension, proximal muscle weakness/\nmyopathy, diabetes, obesity, osteopenia and osteoporosis, and psychiatric disturbances. The association of these fea -\ntures with characteristic cutaneous and physical changes \nshould raise the possibility of Cushing syndrome.\nCutaneous findings in hypercortisolism include cuta -\nneous atrophy, striae, purpura, telangiectasias, and acne. \nCutaneous atrophy is caused by a reduction in both epi -\ndermal and dermal components. There is thinning of the \nepidermis, and collagen synthesis is reduced. There is also \nloss of elastic fibers and dermal mucopolysaccharides. A \nweakened dermis and obesity result in the development \nof prominent striae ( Fig. 27-1 ). The skin is injured eas -\nily by minor trauma. Purpura, skin tears, and ulcerations \nresult; these, in turn, heal slowly due to the inhibiting \neffects of cortisol on wound healing.\nSubcutaneous fat deposition over the face and trunk \ncontributes to the characteristic moon facies and body \nhabitus\u2014buffalo hump, supraclavicular fat pad, and central \nadiposity. Erythrocytosis, telangiectasias, and cutaneous \natrophy also contribute to the characteristic facial appear -\nance, which is notably round and plethoric. Steroid acne \nmay also occur. This disorder is distinguished from typical \nacne vulgaris by the absence of a comedonal component as \nwell as by the monomorphic appearance of its red papules \nand pustules, which are in a uniform stage of development. \nThe usual distribution is on the upper trunk, shoulders, \nand arms, with relative sparing of the face. Patients with \nhypercortisolism are also predisposed to the development \nof chronic fungal infections of the skin (tinea versicolor, \ndermatophytosis, and candidal infections). When hyper -\ncortisolism is caused by increased ACTH production, hy -\nperpigmentation may occur, as in adrenal insufficiency.\nCortisol levels can be increased in several disorders \nother than Cushing syndrome. This scenario, a kind of \nphysiologic hypercortisolism, is known as pseudo-Cushing \nsyndrome. Possible causes include physiologic stress, \nsuch as is seen in the setting of severe infection; signifi -\ncant obesity or polycystic ovary syndrome; psychological \nstress, such as severe major depressive disorder; and, in \nrare cases, chronic alcoholism.

Mu -\ncormycetes are ubiquitous saprophytic molds found in soil \nand decaying matter. Infection occurs usually in patients \nwith organ transplantation, hematologic malignancy, \nor uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. Mucormycetes infec -\ntions are rising in frequency with the advent of antifun -\ngal prophylaxis targeting Aspergillus  in the bone marrow \ntransplant setting. In mammalian tissues, the fungi are \nangiotropic, producing extensive hyphal invasion of blood \nvessels, rapidly leading to widespread vascular thrombosis \nand tissue necrosis.\nClinical Manifestations\nThe most common form of mucormycosis with cutaneous \ninvolvement is rhinocerebral infection. It has a particular \naffinity for patients with diabetic ketoacidosis and starts \nacutely with midfacial and periorbital swelling, necrotic in -\ntranasal ulcers, invasion of nasal sinuses, and bloody nasal \ndischarge. Rapid extension into deeper tissues may cause \ncranial nerve palsies en route to frequently fatal cerebral \ninvolvement. In addition, cutaneous lesions may follow \nhematogenous spread from primary pulmonary disease or \nfrom rare primary inoculation of the skin. Disseminated \ncutaneous lesions often produce necrotic ulcers with black \neschars, resembling ecthyma gangrenosum.\nDiagnosis\nPossible mucormycosis must be evaluated emergently be -\ncause of its high mortality, even when treated with appro -\npriate antifungal agents. If cutaneous infection is suspected, \nrapid diagnosis is important, and may be augmented with \nfrozen-section biopsies or touch-prep examinations of skin \nspecimens in real time. In skin biopsy specimens, mucormy -\ncosis appears as extensive networks of intravascular (angio -\ninvasive) hyphae that have variable widths, lack septae, and \nbranch at near right angles (vs the uniform caliber of derma -\ntophyte hyphae, which are regularly septate and have regu -\nlar acute-angle bifurcations). Mucormycetes grow quickly \non culture, producing cottony or woolly colonies, which \nrequire microscopic examination for speciation.\nTreatment\nManaging mucormycosis requires a multidisciplinary ap -\nproach. Addressing the patient\u2019s immunocompromised \nstate, if possible, is essential; often this means controlling \ndiabetic ketoacidosis. Surgical debridement of infected tis -\nsues may be necessary, and is indicated in most cases of \neither limited or primary cutaneous/primary inoculation \nmucormycotic infections. Liposomal amphotericin B is the \ntreatment of choice for serious infections. Newer third-gen -\neration azole agents, e.g., posaconazole, may help patients \nwith lesser infections or who cannot tolerate amphotericin.\nASPERGILLOSIS\nAspergillosis is an opportunistic infection caused \nby several Aspergillus  species, commonly Aspergillus fumigatus  and Aspergillus niger . These and other Asper -\ngillus  species are often cultured from nails and cuta -\nneous surfaces, yet misinterpreted as pathogens rather \nthan recognized as benign commensal fungi. True cu -\ntaneous infections with Aspergillus  may be primary or \nsecondary conditions. Primary aspergillosis is caused \nby direct inoculation from contaminated materials, \nwhich, while rare, is more common in children than \nadults. More common overall is secondary cutaneous \naspergillosis, which follows lymphatic or hematog -\nenous spread from primary pulmonary foci. Patients \nwith hematologic malignancies, those on immunosup -\npressive medications, and children with chronic granu -\nlomatous disease or cystic fibrosis are at risk for sys -\ntemic aspergillosis.\nClinical Manifestations\nAspergillus  pathogens cause several pulmonary syndromes, \nas well as disseminated aspergillosis, which can produce \nsecondary cutaneous lesions, endocarditis, and endo -\nphthalmitis.

One theory postulates \nthat increased intraluminal pressure in the capillaries \ncauses leakage of fibrinogen through capillary walls with \ndeposition of pericapillary fibrin cuffs and impairment \nof oxygen or nutrient diffusion to tissue; together, these \nchanges may result in tissue necrosis and ulceration \n(Fig. 46-6 ). A second theory regarding the mechanism \nof injury posits that the known sludging of white blood \ncells in venous insufficiency causes capillary obstruc -\ntion. Trapped white blood cells may become activated \nand release proteolytic enzymes that promote ulcer -\nation. A third theory, the \u201ctrap\u201d hypothesis, suggests \nthat the leakage of fibrin and other macromolecules into \nthe dermis traps or binds growth factors and reduces the \namount available for tissue repair.\nPathophysiology of Arterial Ulceration\nArterial insufficiency results in local ulceration and skin, \ndigital or even limb necrosis, depending on the severity of \nischemia; the failure to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the \nleg results in tissue breakdown. Progressive atherosclero sis \nis the most common etiology, where the arteries become \nstenotic as a resultant of deposits of lipid and plaque depo -\nsition in arterial vessel walls. While some restrict the term \nto large vessel disease, any other process that ob structs \nthe arterial flow can result in an arterial ulceration. Dis -\neases associated with arterial insufficiency and formation \nof ischemic ulcers include large-vessel disease (thrombo -\nangiitis obliterans, arteriovenous malformations), small-\nvessel disease (Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon), microthrombotic \ndisease (antiphospholipid syndrome, cryoglobulinemia, and cholesterol emboli), vasculitis, sickle cell disease, and \npolycythemia vera, among others.\nPATIENT HISTORY AND PHYSICAL \nEXAMINATION FINDINGS\n\t\u2022\t\tThorough\texamination\tof\tarterial\tsupply\tis\tessential\tin\t\npatients with leg ulcerations.\n\t\u2022\t\tPhysical\texamination\tshould\tinclude\tpalpation\tfor\tdorsa -\nlis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses.\n\t\u2022\t\tScreening\tfor\tarterial\tinsufficiency\tshould\tbe\tperformed\t\nif clinically relevant, with the measurement of ankle\u2013bra -\nchial pressure index (ABI).\n\t\u2022\t\tIf\tABI\tis\t>0.7,\tcompression\tcan\tbe\tapplied\tsafely.\nHistory\nAn adequate history must be obtained to establish the \ncause of ulceration ( Table 46-2 ).

The annual incidence of SJS and \nTEN is 1.2 to 6 and 0.4 to 1.2 per million individuals, \nrespectively. The annual incidence of SJS and/or TEN in \nHIV patients is estimated at 1 to 2 per 1000 individuals, \napproximately 1000-fold higher than that of the general \npopulation. The incidence of SJS/TEN increases with \nage; children less than 15 years of age account for only \n10% of the samples in most studies. It is characterized \nby widespread keratinocyte apoptosis resulting in exten -\nsive epidermal detachment. SJS and TEN are differenti -\nated quantitatively, depending on the extent of epidermal \ndetachment. By definition SJS affects <10% and TEN \n>30%; those affecting 10 to 30% are classified as SJS/\nTEN overlap. The distinction between these entities is \ncrucial as TEN has a mortality of 25 to 30% whereas SJS \nhas a mortality of 1 to 5%.\nDrug exposure is the most common cause of SJS/\nTEN, with more than 200 drugs identified. Other causes \ninclude infections ( M. pneumoniae , dengue fever, cyto -\nmegalovirus, and Yersinia enterocolitica ), contrast media, \nand vaccinations. Fuchs syndrome is a unique type of SJS \ninvolving the mucosal membranes without skin lesions, \nwhich was reported to be associated with M. pneumoniae  \npredominantly in children and adolescents; some authors \nconsider this a separate and distinct syndrome, as those \npatients often display a better prognosis.\nSymptoms usually start within 4 to 28 days of the drug \ninitiation.

They are caused by a poxvirus. Infections \nwith MC are more common in patients with atopic derma -\ntitis and in immunocompromised hosts (see Chapters 33 \nand 35) . In the latter group, lesions can prove difficult to \ntreat. Cutaneous lesions of cryptococcosis and systemic \ndimorphic fungal infections can resemble MC, and there -\nfore dermal scrapings or a skin biopsy specimen should be \nexamined if the diagnosis is uncertain.\nBacterial\nPyogenic Bacteria\nStaphylococcus aureus  causes the majority of all pyodermas \nand soft-tissue infections seen in transplant recipients. \nThe incidence of S. aureus  nasal carriage is higher in trans -\nplant recipients and the spectrum of pyodermas includes  \nfolliculitis, furuncles, abscesses, impetigo, and ecthyma. \nTheir clinical presentations may be atypical owing to the \nconcomitant immunosuppression ( Fig. 39-6 ); in the case of \ncellulitis, there may be less erythema than is observed in \nnormal hosts. Meticillin-resistant S. aureus  is a problem in \ntransplant patients as it is in immunocompetent hosts there -\nfore cultures must always be taken in soft tissue infections.\nIncision and drainage of abscesses is a key compo -\nnent of treatment, and for severe infections empiric  \nintravenous vancomycin or linezolid is recommended \nuntil antimicrobial susceptibility results become avail -\nable. Streptococcus pyogenes  commonly colonizes the upper \nrespiratory tract and secondarily infects (impetiginizes) \nminor skin lesions from which invasive infection can \narise. Other streptococci, such as Group B streptococ -\nci, commonly colonize the perineum causing soft tissue \ninfection. Immunosuppressed patients are particularly \nprone to necrotizing fasciitis, a severe form of soft tissue \ninfection extending into the subcutaneous fat and deep \nfascia. Treatment includes broad antibiotic coverage, often supplemented with clindamycin and possibly in -\ntravenous immunoglobulin, in addition to intensive care \nmonitoring and surgical debridement as appropriate.\nA condition dubbed \u201ctransplant elbow,\u201d consisting of \nrecurrent staphylococcal infections in the skin overly -\ning the extensor elbows, has been described in transplant \nrecipients. The cause is related to skin atrophy second -\nary to the use of systemic corticosteroids, and is linked \nto repeated trauma produced when the patients use their \nelbows to rise from sitting because of the corticosteroid-\ninduced myopathy affecting the hip girdle.\nIn transplant patients the cause of cutaneous infections \ncannot be assumed to be Gram-positive cocci: additional \norganisms need to be considered, such as Gram-negative \nrods ( Fig. 39-7 ), Gram-positive rods (e.g., Bacillus cereus ), \natypical mycobacteria, herpesviruses, and opportunistic \nfungi and parasites. In immunocompromised hosts there \nare multiple infectious etiologies for lesions that resemble \necthyma gangrenosum (see below), i.e., the list extends \nbeyond Pseudomonas aeruginosa .\nNocardia . Both cutaneous and systemic nocardiosis have \nbeen reported in transplant patients. Hematogenous dis -\nsemination from a pulmonary focus can lead to secondary \nsites of infection in the skin, as well as in other organs such \nas the brain. Primary cutaneous infection can present as \nabscesses, ulcers, granulomas, soft-tissue infection, myce -\ntoma, or sporotrichoid infection. If cutaneous nocardiosis \nis diagnosed in a transplant patient, it is important to look \nfor additional sites of involvement to determine if it is \nprimary versus secondary due to dissemination.\nA presumptive diagnosis can be made by identifying \nfine-branching filaments in a Gram stain of dermal scrap -\nings or a biopsy specimen; a modified acid-fast stain can \nalso be used to identify the organisms.

However, given the wide \nclinical phenotypes found even among close relatives, \na defect in the neurofibromin protein cannot in itself \nexplain this variability. Other studies point to evidence \nthat modifying genes (genes that are unlinked to the \nNF1 gene, but play a phenotypical role in neurofibro -\nmatosis) may be behind these differences. Clinical out -\ncomes would depend on where the second mutation at \nanother gene occurs. Finally, recent research has shown \nthat the environment, especially trauma, may lead to \nthe formation of benign neurofibromas.

Psoria -\nsis is found worldwide, and over 125 million people are \nthought to be afflicted. The lowest prevalence rates are \nreported in Asia with less than 0.5%, and the highest in \nNorway at 4.82% and France at 5.20%.\nPsoriasis is more than just a skin disease. Several co -\nmorbidities are associated with psoriasis. About one-third \nof patients may develop psoriatic arthritis, on average \n10 years after psoriasis appears. It has been shown that \nthose with psoriasis are also at higher risk for cardiometa -\nbolic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, dyslipid -\nemia, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. These patients \nare at higher risk for myocardial infarction, stroke, and \ncardiovascular death. They are more likely to develop \nlymphoma, autoimmune disorders, and renal disease. \nFurthermore, patients with psoriasis are more likely to \nhave psychiatric conditions such as depression and anxi -\nety, and are more likely to smoke and drink alcohol.\nPATHOGENESIS\nThe most striking feature of psoriasis is the silvery scal -\ning and redness that sharply demarcates the plaques \nfrom the surrounding normal skin. Histologically it is \ncharacterized by marked hyperproliferation of keratino -\ncytes, altered epidermal differentiation, and proliferation of endothelial cells accompanied by an influx of various \ninflammatory cells. Substantial evidence implicates acti -\nvated T-cells in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Both CD4+ \nand CD8+ T-cells are found in psoriatic skin lesions, with \nCD4+ T-cells being primarily located in the upper der -\nmis and CD8+ T-cells within the epidermis. CD8+ T \ncells in the epidermis are required for the development of \npsoriasis lesions. The CD8+ T-cells are oligoclonal, sug -\ngesting that they are responding to a restricted set of anti -\ngens, likely in the psoriatic epidermis. Multiple other cell \ntypes participate in this process including keratinocytes, \ndendritic cells, macrophages, mast cells, endothelial cells, \nand neutrophils. Cytokines initiate and sustain inflamma -\ntion through pathways that involve cells of both the innate \nand acquired immune systems. These pathways, includ -\ning tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling and the IL-23/\nTh17 (interleukin-23/T helper 17) pathways, are critical, \nas blockade of either one is highly effective for treatment. \nInterestingly, the mechanism of action for TNF inhibi -\ntors, such as etanercept, appears to be due to suppression \nof IL-17 signaling rather than a direct response to TNF. \nBesides IL-17 and TNF- \u03b1, multiple other cytokines and \ngrowth factors participate in this process, and the interac -\ntion is incompletely understood.\nIt has been known for over 100 years that psoriasis has \na strong genetic component. However, it is only in the \npast few years that major strides have been made in iden -\ntifying the specific genetic risk factors, mostly through \ngenome-wide association studies. To date over 40 inde -\npendent genetic signals have been identified. One of the \nmost prominent genetic signals identified in psoriasis is \nHLA-Cw6. Several other risk loci are close to genes in -\nvolved in antigen processing and presentation, including \nthe ERAP1  and ERAP2  genes, which may tie in with the \nrole of CD8+ T-cell function, as those cells respond to \nantigens in the context of major histocompatibility com -\nplex class I. Several of the risk loci are close to genes that \nplay key roles in IL-23/IL-17 responses and others map \nto regions involved in epidermal barrier formation, in -\nflammatory dendritic cell function, nuclear factor kappa \nbeta, interferon signaling, and Th1/Th2 polarization. \nThese genetic findings, along with progress in our un -\nderstanding of the immunology, highlight the key patho -\ngenic circuits and increase our ability to more effectively \ntreat this disease.\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\nChronic plaque psoriasis/psoriasis vulgaris is the most \ncommon clinical form of psoriasis, and is found in ap -\nproximately 90% of patients.",

Recurrent EM that is caused by HSV infection may be prevented by reducing the frequen -\ncy of herpes infections (e.g., sunscreen use on the lips to  \nreduce the frequency of sun-exacerbated herpes labialis). \nOral acyclovir (200  mg twice daily), valacyclovir (500  mg  \nonce or twice daily), or famciclovir (250  mg twice daily)  \ncan reduce the incidence of herpes infection recurrences. Higher doses may be needed for HIV patients or other im -\nmunocompromised states. Oral prednisone may be utilized to decrease the mucocutaneous inflammation in EM and should be considered for patients with severe oral disease who cannot tolerate oral intake or require hospitalization.\nThe mortality rate in SJS may approach 5% and \noverall mortality in TEN may approach 30%. Mortal -\nity is reduced by withdrawal of the causative agent within \n24 hours and early intervention with supportive care in an  \nICU or burn unit. An underlying drug allergy or infec-tion must be diagnosed and corrected quickly. Supportive care may include maintaining the patient\u2019s fluid balance, temperature control, skin and mucosal barrier protec -\ntion with aggressive emollient use, and recognition and treatment of infections. Ophthalmologic consultation should be obtained early to prevent corneal scarring from secondary bacterial infections. Oral care should include compresses and oral rinses. Urethral stricture must be prevented in male patients with penile involvement, and gynecologic supportive care is essential in cases of vaginal mucosal sloughing. These patients should also be moni -\ntored to exclude urinary retention.\nSystemic pharmacologic therapy is controversial and \nthere remains no consensus. Corticosteroid therapy is a controversial treatment in SJS and TEN. Several studies have found conflicting conclusions about the efficacy of corticosteroids compared to supportive therapy. In fact, some studies have found an association with increased infections, duration of hospital stay, and mortality. Sev-eral reports, as well as our own observations, suggest that SJS can respond rapidly to high-dose intravenous \ncorticosteroids (1 to 2  mg/kg) given early and short term  \n(7 to 10  days). As for TEN, we may briefly use high-dose \nintravenous corticosteroids, but small studies and expert consensus opinion favor the use of IVIg or cyclosporine for treatment.\nIVIg has been of interest in the treatment of TEN \nbecause of its potential to inhibit Fas-FasL-mediated keratinocyte apoptosis. Although the use of IVIg is con -\ntroversial because some reports suggest a lack of ben -\nefit, examination of the literature notes, variations in timing of treatment, dosing, IVIg batch preparations, and most of the case series have variable numbers of patients with comorbid conditions that might affect the outcome. Our experience and several reports suggest that the use of early (especially when the Nikolsky sign is still positive), high-dose IVIg can reduce mortality. Therapy must be given early in the course of the disease over several days, usually 3, in order to deliver a total \nof 3 to 4  g/kg.\nMore recently there has been interest in therapy for \nTEN with cyclosporine, a calcineurin inhibitor that \n reduces lymphokine production and interleukin release \nresulting in reduced function of effector T cells. In a few recent studies it has been found to improve mortal -\nity. The dose of cyclosporine used varies between 3 and \n5 mg/kg/day for an average of 7  days. TNF- \u03b1 inhibitors \nhave also been suggested, but cautious use is recom -\nmended because of the detrimental effects seen with thalidomide. Plasmapheresis has been shown in several reports to provide rapid improvement, possibly from the removal of proinflammatory cytokines.",

Recogni -\ntion of the multisystem aspects of these conditions by \nboth dermatologists and cardiologists is imperative for \nproper diagnosis and management. Awareness of poten -\ntial cutaneous complications of cardiac therapies is also \nessential for the dermatologist. Therapies directed at \nimprovement of muscle function (e.g., digoxin) rarely \nresult in cutaneous disease, while therapies seeking to \nachieve fluid reduction (diuretics), afterload reduction, \nand control of rhythmic disturbances can affect the skin. \nIn addition, increasingly frequent use of potent immu -\nnosuppressive agents for autoimmune cardiovascular \ndisease and cardiac transplantation may lead to a variety \nof dermatologic manifestations, including an increased \nrisk of skin cancers, again emphasizing the need for in -\nterspecialty collaboration.\nThis text reviews several multisystem disorders with \nassociated cardiovascular abnormalities.

The \ndisorder may be primary or secondary to an associated au -\ntoimmune disease, the most common of which is systemic \nlupus erythematosus. Symptoms result from antibody-\ndriven arterial or venous thrombogenesis, and most com -\nmonly include cutaneous findings, deep vein thrombosis, \npulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accidents, and/\nor recurrent fetal loss. Thrombocytopenia is often seen \nand, importantly, does not influence the risk of thrombo -\nsis. The most common skin finding is livedo reticularis or \nracemosa ( Fig. 37-1 ). Leg ulcerations, retiform purpura, \nlivedoid vasculopathy, or superficial thrombophlebitis \nmay also occur. Myocardial infarction and cardiac valvu -\nlar disease, including nonbacterial vegetations, have been \ndescribed, potentially predisposing the patient to bacte -\nrial endocarditis. Cutaneous manifestations are often the \npresenting feature of APS, placing the dermatologist in \nan important role for diagnosing this potentially morbid \ncondition. The presence of livedo racemosa in particular \nin patients with APS has been associated with an increased \nrisk for arterial thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis, and \nheart valve abnormalities, and should alert dermatologists \nto these potential complications. Recently updated diag -\nnostic criteria require antiphospholipid antibody positivity \non two serologic tests separated by 12 weeks, along with \nevidence of objectively confirmed thrombosis or pregnan -\ncy morbidity. Therapy is dependent upon the history of \nthromboembolic events, and includes anticoagulants and \nplatelet inhibitors, as well as approaches aimed at lowering \nantibody levels. Hydroxychloroquine may also help pre -\nvent thrombosis, particularly in those with systemic lupus \nerythematosus, although a convincing body of evidence is \nlacking. Whether therapy has an effect on cardiac invol-\nvement remains unknown, although low-dose aspirin or  \nanticoagulation is frequently recommended in this setting.\nCARCINOID SYNDROME\nCarcinoid syndrome refers to a constellation of symp -\ntoms caused by the release of neuroendocrine vasoactive CHAPTER 37\nCardiovasCular  diseases   \nand the skin\nAlisa Femia \u2022 Kathryn Schwarzenberger \u2022 Jeffrey P .

Chronic pruritus is defined as an itch that lasts more \nthan 6  weeks. It has a significant impact on patients\u2019  \nquality of life, very similar to chronic pain. It is the pri -\nmary symptom in a diverse range of inflammatory skin diseases, such as atopic eczema, psoriasis, dry skin, and chronic urticaria (Table 13-1). It can occur without any primary skin eruption associated with underlying sys -\ntemic diseases (Table 13-2), and can be the presenting symptom of lymphoma, hepatic diseases such as biliary cirrhosis and hepatitis C, and HIV viral infections. It can occur in relation to primary damage to nerve fibers, such as postherpetic neuropathy, as well as spinal nerve root injuries such as brachioradial pruritus and notalgia par -\nesthetica, and in afferent nerves in the central nervous system post stroke. Pruritus is a common symptom in psychiatric diseases such as obsessive compulsive disor -\nders, depression, and in delusions of parasitosis.\nSKIN SIGNS OF CHRONIC PRURITUS\nThere are common skin lesions that develop in pruritus as a result of repetitive scratching and rubbing of the skin. These lesions are not considered a primary skin eruption. They include excoriations such as prurigo nodules (exco -\nriated papules that lead to nodule formation). These are usually distributed on the extensor side of the limbs and upper back. Lichenification is a thickened plaque with marked accentuation of the skin creases, which develops as a result of continuous rubbing and scratching, gener -\nally in areas that the patient can easily scratch and rub, such as the nape of the neck, below the elbow, the ankle, the buttocks, and the genitalia. Changes in skin pigmen -\ntation\u2014both hyper- and hypopigmentation\u2014can occur because of repeated scratching. Excoriated lesions result -\ning from repetitive scratching, as well as primary eczema -\ntous lesions, can become infected, particularly in patients with atopic dermatitis.\nThe middle of the back, which cannot be easily \nreached, may show normal skin or relative hypopigmen -\ntation, in contrast to the hyperpigmentation of the areas subjected to persistent scratching, thereby resulting in a butterfly pattern. The finger nails may be shiny because of prolonged rubbing.\nCOMMON COMPLICATIONS IN PATIENTS  \nWITH GENERALIZED PRURITUS\nPatients with chronic pruritus often have difficulty sleep -\ning, are agitated, and suffer from depression, and de -\ncreased sexual desire and sexual function, suggestive of a significant impairment of quality of life.\nDIAGNOSIS\nWhen no diagnosis of a primarily dermatological disor -\nder can be made, a history, review of systems, physical examination, and screening laboratory examination are needed.\nA detailed history is important. One should investigate \nwhether the patient suffers from generalized or localized itching. A localized itch may be associated with a burn -\ning sensation and pain in peripheral neuropathy, such as damage to cervical spinal nerve roots in brachioradial pruritus or thoracic nerve roots in notalgia paresthetica. Careful history also includes a drug history, as drugs such as opiates, aspirin, and the new targeted cancer therapies such as estimated glomerular filtration rate inhibitors can induce itch with and without a cutaneous eruption. A simple question, such as whether pruritus occurs in other family members, can indicate the possibility of scabies and prevent unnecessary investigation. Recent travel to endemic areas of parasitic infection and gastrointestinal complaints may be suggestive of parasitic infection. A positive review of systems, especially in relation to gen -\neral health, such as weight loss, night sweats, and tremor, could point to a systemic cause.\nSome pruritic states have specific clinical patterns.

Extra-articular manifestations \ncommonly involve the skin and/or the lungs, but may also \ninvolve the hematologic, cardiovascular, and neurologic \nsystems. RA primarily affects females between the fourth \nand sixth decades of life, but can occur at all ages.\nThe diagnosis of RA is relatively easy to make in its \nadvanced stages but is challenging early in the disease \ncourse. The diagnosis is based on a combination of clini -\ncal, radiographic, and laboratory findings, including the \nserum rheumatoid factor. Criteria have been developed \nby the American College of Rheumatology for the diag -\nnosis of classic, definite, probable, and possible RA, as \nwell as for determining clinical remission, disease pro -\ngression, and the functional capacity of patients. Histo -\nlogic changes in the synovium and the presence of skin \nnodules are additional criteria. The rheumatoid factor \n(RF), measured primarily as IgM with specificity against \naltered IgG, is positive in approximately 75% of patients \nwith RA and in 5% to 10% of normal subjects. The pres -\nence of second-generation anticyclic citrullinated peptide \nis similar in sensitivity to RF, but is more specific at 90% \nto 95%. High levels of RF are generally associated with \nmore severe, erosive forms of the disease, as well as with \nthe presence of extra-articular manifestations including \nrheumatoid nodules and other associated skin disorders. \nHLA-DRB1*04 is the most significant genetic association \nwith seropositive RA.

Interleukin (IL)-4 receptor single-nucleotide \npolymorphisms have been associated with increased risk \nof joint destruction and rheumatoid nodules.\nCutaneous Manifestations\nA number of cutaneous findings are reported with RA. \nFew of these are characteristic for the disease, with the \nnotable exception of the rheumatoid nodule.

This discussion \nprovides a broad overview of the most important neurocu -\ntaneous disorders as well as a variety of other conditions in \nwhich cutaneous and nervous system findings are shared.\nCLASSIFICATION\nThe relationship between the skin and the nervous sys -\ntem may be based on: (1) a developmental abnormality, \nfrequently a result of a shared embryogenesis; or (2) the \nsystemic effect on both organ systems of a metabolic \ndisorder, infection, or immune response. The develop -\nmental and metabolic disorders are primarily of genetic \norigin, whereas the infectious and immune abnormalities \nrepresent the response of the skin and nervous system to \na common insult. The neural crest is a transient embry -\nonic structure that gives rise to dorsal root ganglion cells, \nSchwann cells, autonomic ganglion cells, as well as mela -\nnocytes. Abnormalities of the neural crest cells lead to a \nmyriad of clinical findings. Unfortunately, the resulting \ndisease entities can seldom be distilled to a pattern that \ncan be totally explained by deductive reasoning. Disor -\nders involving both the skin and the nervous system can \nbe briefly categorized if one includes only the phakoma -\ntoses, but the list becomes very extensive if less common \nsyndromes and systemic diseases involving both organ \nsystems are included. The classifications in Table 40-1  \ninclude the classic neurocutaneous disorders and repre -\nsentative examples of various syndromes.\nThe term \u201cphakomatosis\u201d is derived from the Greek \nword \u201cphakos\u201d meaning \u201cmother spot or mole.\u201d Although \noriginally used to describe the retinal lesions of tuberous \nsclerosis, it has come to refer to a group of disorders in -\ncluding: (1) tuberous sclerosis complex; (2) neurofibroma -\ntosis; (3) Sturge\u2013Weber disease; and (4) VHL syndrome. \nThese disorders, as well as other vascular abnormalities, \nwill be discussed in detail. The remainder of the develop -\nmental disorders represents disorders of epidermal cells \nand their appendages that share an ectodermal origin \nwith the nervous system. The syndromes mentioned in  \nTable 40-1  are rare but represent examples of probable \nneural crest abnormalities as well as poorly understood but \nwell-documented disorders involving both the skin and the \nnervous system.CHAPTER 40\nNeurocutaNeous  Disease\nSarah D.

A third-generation cephalosporine such as \nceftriaxone or cefotaxime is currently the treatment of \nchoice until culture and sensitivity are established. The \ncorrection of hemodynamic instability, often in an inten -\nsive care unit, is of paramount importance.\nEcthyma Gangrenosum\nPatients with ecthyma gangrenosum are typically gravely \nill with pustules or hemorrhagic macules surrounded by \nviolaceous halos. The lesions evolve to round ulcers with \nnecrotic black centers. Common sites include intertrigi -\nnous sites, the buttocks, and extremities.

Until the development of more effective anti-\nCMV medications, this virus accounted for up to 25% \nof deaths, 20% of graft failures, 30% of febrile epi -\nsodes, and 35% of leukopenic episodes in renal trans -\nplant  patients. One of the major advances, especially \nin  allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant pa -\ntients, has been the use of weekly antibody staining \nof circulating neutrophils or weekly PCR-based as -\nsays of peripheral blood as a means of detecting CMV \nantigen or CMV DNA, respectively, and hence early \n infections. The latter assays are particularly helpful in \nneutropenic patients. In the setting of positive results, \n\u201cpreemptive\u201d oral valganciclovir or intravenous ganci -\nclovir therapy can be instituted prior to the develop -\nment of clinical symptoms such as fever, pneumonitis, \nor enterocolitis.Infections in transplant recipients may be primary, i.e., \ndue to the presence of CMV in the transplanted organ or \ncells, or they may represent reactivation of a latent infec -\ntion. In the past, clinical infections were most common \nduring the first 6 months after transplantation; e.g., in \none series of kidney transplant patients the median time \nof onset was 46 days after transplantation. However, with \nmore solid organ transplant patients receiving prophylac -\ntic therapy during the first 3 months after transplantation, \nthe time of onset is often delayed until after discontinua -\ntion of antiviral therapy.\nClinical manifestations of CMV infection include leuko -\npenia, pneumonitis, gastroenteritis, retinitis, hepatitis, and \nencephalitis, as well as a mononucleosis-type syndrome.  \nSkin involvement is present in a small percentage of  \npatients with systemic CMV infection; cutaneous presen -\ntations include morbilliform eruptions, verrucous plaques, \npetechiae and purpura, and ulcerations. It can also be \nseen incidentally in cutaneous biopsies in patients with no  \nactive eruption. In mucocutaneous ulcers CMV often coex -\nists with other viruses such as HSV or VZV, and as a result \nits true pathogenicity has been questioned.\nThe diagnosis of CMV infection is suggested histo -\npathologically by the presence of intranuclear inclusions \nsurrounded by a halo within endothelial cells. Viral cul -\nture or a PCR-based assay of involved tissues, including \nthe skin, is required for confirmation. It is important not \nto confuse active infection with viral shedding, as is com -\nmonly seen in the urine or throat washings of transplant \npatients.\nHuman Herpesvirus 6\nIn addition to causing exanthema subitum (roseola in -\nfantum) in healthy young children, human herpesvirus 6 \n(HHV-6) has been associated with fever, pancytopenia, \npneumonitis, gastroenteritis, and encephalitis in trans -\nplant patients. There are also a few scattered reports of \nan associated morbilliform eruption at the time of reacti -\nvation. Viral DNA can be detected in the skin as well as \nperipheral blood mononuclear cells.\nEpstein\u2013Barr Virus and Human Herpesvirus 8\nInfections with two other herpesviruses, Epstein\u2013\nBarr virus (EBV) and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), \nare associated with the development of neoplasms in \ntransplant patients: post-transplant lymphoprolifera -\ntive disorder and Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma (KS), respectively. \nThe term post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder \nis used rather than lymphoma because the histologic \nfindings range from a polyclonal B-cell infiltrate to a \nmonoclonal B-cell lymphoma. Rarely, T-cell lympho -\nmas are seen.\nBecause this lymphoproliferative disorder is reflective \nof \u201cover\u201d-immunosuppression, a reduction in immuno -\nsuppressive therapy is a component of the initial thera -\npy.

In summary, it \nappears that this is an unusual mucocutaneous disorder with myriad clinicopathologic findings, some of which are not a part of any of the forms of pemphigus.\nOther sporadic and poorly understood associations \nwith pemphigus include pernicious anemia, red blood cell aplasia, rheumatoid arthritis, and lymphomatoid granulomatosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThe differential diagnosis of blistering disorders of the skin ranges from a wide variety of banal dermatoses to more serious and progressive disorders such as pemphigus, bullous pemphigoid ( Fig. 16-4), and epidermolysis bullosa \nacquisita. These disorders require clinical, histopathologic, and immunopathologic evaluation for definite diagnosis. When the etiology of blistering disorders cannot be recog -\nnized, biopsy is warranted. Subsequent decisions are made on the basis of these findings. Histopathologic character -\nistics of potential blistering disorders that will not be dis -\ncussed here in detail are listed in Table 16-1.\nMany patients with oral ulcerations of pemphigus \nare misdiagnosed as having aphthous stomatitis. After months to years, however, such patients typically prog -\nress to have extramucosal involvement.\nAcantholysis is the hallmark of immunologically me -\ndiated pemphigus, but it may also be seen in Grover\u2019s disease (transient acantholytic dermatosis), Darier\u2019s dis -\nease (keratosis follicularis), and Hailey\u2013Hailey\u2019s disease (benign familial pemphigus). In Grover\u2019s disease there is involvement of the trunk with pruritic papulovesicles, but no oral involvement. It is frequently precipitated by sun exposure or heat and lasts for weeks to months, although chronic cases are not uncommon.\nDarier\u2019s disease is an autosomal dominant disorder \ncharacterized by yellowish-brown crusted papules on the scalp, intertriginous areas, and seborrheic areas of the face and trunk. The disease is slowly progressive and sel -\ndom overtly bullous. Lesions are frequently perifollicu -\nlar. Although acantholysis is suprabasilar, as in pemphigus vulgaris, characteristic dyskeratotic changes (corps ronds and grains) occur within the epidermis.\nHailey\u2013Hailey\u2019s disease (benign familial pemphigus) is \nan autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multi -\nple grouped erythematous vesicles in intertriginous areas. Mucosal surfaces are usually spared. There is extensive loss of intercellular bridges, with partial coherence of cells throughout all levels of the epidermis.\nThe clinical pattern of these acantholytic disorders is \nusually distinctive from that of pemphigus. If confusion exists, direct immunofluorescence of perilesional skin is negative for IgG deposition in these disorders, whereas pemphigus patients demonstrate characteristic intercellu -\nlar IgG deposition in stratified squamous epithelial tissues.\nPatient Evaluation\nClose examination of all mucous membranes is indicated.  \nOral involvement is the rule in pemphigus vulgaris, but esophageal as well as vulvar involvement may occur. Significant esophageal symptoms and even stricture may develop. Consequently, esophageal symptoms mandate endoscopy and possible biopsy. Patients presenting with blistering skin disorders that cannot be easily explained (e.g., friction blisters and contact dermatitis) require bi-opsy. If there is histopathologic acantholysis, biopsy of perilesional skin for direct immunofluorescence should be performed. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrating pemphigus antibodies in the serum fur -\nther confirms the diagnosis, and antibody titers typically correlate with disease activity. Disappearance of antibody from the serum frequently precedes remission.\nChest X-ray to rule out an associated thymoma and a \nsearch for clinical symptoms of myasthenia gravis is part of good clinical care, but a low yield of positive findings is to be expected.

The for -\nmation of an urticarial wheal (Darier\u2019s sign) ( Fig. 42-5 ) at \nthe lesion site is indicative of mast cell mediator release. \nDarier\u2019s sign is readily demonstrated in mastocytomas and \nchildhood UP lesions, whereas it may be barely detectable \nin common adult mast cell disease lesions and TMEP. This \ncan be explained by the fact that mast cell concentrations \nin mastocytomas and childhood UP are approximately 150 \nand 40 times, respectively, higher than in normal skin. The \nmast cell content in adult mast cell disease lesions is only \neight to nine times greater than in normal skin.\nSystemic Manifestations\nSkeletal involvement is common in adult patients with \nSM, with a reported incidence of approximately 70%.

Osteoporosis \nis the most common change in patients with diffuse skel -\netal disease, followed by osteosclerosis and mixed lesions \nof osteosclerosis and osteoporosis. These bony changes \nare believed to result from the local release of mast cell \nmediators. Children with mastocytosis rarely have bone \ninvolvement.\nBone marrow involvement frequently (70% to 90%) \noccurs in adult SM patients but is rarely seen in children. \nThe diagnosis of mast cell disease in the bone marrow is \nestablished by identifying clusters of MCs (>15 tryptase-\npositive staining MCs/cluster) that express CD25 and/\nor CD2, which are not routinely detected on normal \nMCs. The diagnosis of SM on bone marrow biopsy may \nbe difficult in patients with SM-AHNMD because of \nthe coexistence of the hematologic disorder. The pres -\nence of >5% MCs on a bone marrow aspirate smear in \nSM patients suggests an unfavorable prognosis, and the \nidentification of >20% MCs on a bone marrow smear is \ndiagnostic of MCL.\nSplenomegaly has been reported in approximately \n50% of adult SM patients; however, in two recent larger \nstudies, each with over 140 adult mastocytosis patients, \nsplenomegaly was observed in only 8% to 9% of individ -\nuals.

Among 58 \npatients, with systemic involvement, 26% had peripheral \nlymphadenopathy, whereas 19% had central nodal dis -\nease. Patients with SM also may experience gastrointes -\ntinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, \nand vomiting. Diarrhea is usually episodic and can result \nfrom malabsorption, increased motility, and/or acid hy -\npersecretion. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage has been re -\nported in some patients with SM, and is often secondary \nto gastritis or peptic ulcers.

In the absence of \ncirculating antibody, immunoelectron microscopy is the only reliable way to separate BP from EBA. In this situa -\ntion EBA will demonstrate deposition of IgG in the sub -\nlamina densa area of the anchoring fibrils, whereas BP IgG deposition will be in the lamina lucida.\nThe classic clinical and histopathologic presentation \nof EBA closely resembles that of porphyria cutanea tar -\nda, but EBA patients have normal uroporphyrins. Dif -\nferentiation of EBA from other forms of epidermolysis bullosa includes the adult onset, as well as a negative  \nfamily history of EBA. The inflammatory variant may also closely mimic drug-induced bullous erythema mul-tiforme, which, however, lacks the characteristic findings of EBA on direct immunofluorescence.\nPatient Evaluation\nThe evaluation of patients with EBA is essentially the same as that for patients with BP. However, because EBA can cause scarring on mucosal surfaces, a multidis -\nciplinary approach involving gastroenterology, otolar -\nyngology, ophthalmology, dentistry, and speech therapy may be required to deal with these complications. Corre -\nlation of antibody titer with disease activity has not been well evaluated.\nTreatment\nThe treatment of EBA is similar to that for BP. However, EBA tends to be progressive and unrelenting, and is much more resistant to treatment with systemic corticosteroids than is BP. In a review by Engineer, small series and case reports were summarized showing promising results with cyclosporine, colchicine, and IVIg.\nDERMATITIS HERPETIFORMIS\nDermatitis herpetiformis (DH), or Duhring\u2019s disease, is characterized by involvement of extensor surfaces with grouped, pruritic, erythematous papulovesicles  \n(Fig. 16-8). Biopsy demonstrates a blister at the base -\nment membrane with accumulation of neutrophils in the dermal papillary tips. Perilesional skin demonstrates the pathognomonic deposition of granular IgA in dermal papillary tips. More than 90% of patients with DH have the HLA-DQ2 genotype, compared to 20% of controls. This offers a unique background on which gluten sensi -\ntivity and the subsequent IgA immune response develop. Virtually all DH patients have gluten-sensitive enteropa -\nthy on small bowel biopsy, but gastrointestinal symptoms occur in only about 25% of cases. The skin disease as well as the associated gluten-sensitive enteropathy improves with dietary restriction of gluten.\nPathogenesis\nThe skin disease as well as the intestinal lesions respond to \na strict gluten-free diet, although it may take 3 to 6  months  \nfor clinical improvement. IgA also clears from the skin with prolonged gluten restriction. This indicates a central role for gluten ingestion and IgA in the pathogenesis.\nThe HLA-DQ2 antigen is found in 90% of celiac \ndisease and DH patients and only 20% of controls. It is believed that this genetic background is essential to pre-sentation of the gluten antigen to the mucosal immune system. The intestinal lesion is then produced by an in -\ntestinal inflammatory infiltrate of mononuclear cells. However, it is unknown how gluten triggers IgA binding to skin, and how IgA triggers neutrophil infiltration and the inflammatory cascade. An antigen to which the IgA antibodies bind in the skin has been identified as epider -\nmal transglutaminase (TG3).\nThe proposed pathogenesis of DH and celiac disease is \nan immune response to gliadin antigen, a digestion prod -\nuct of gluten, which is present in rye, barley, and wheat. Glutamine residues within gliadin are absorbed into the lamina propria of the small intestine and deamidated by tissue transglutaminase (TG2). Deamidated gliadin then binds to the groove on dendritic antigen-presenting cells and the antigen is presented to T-helper cells. Plasma cells then produce IgA antibodies to multiple antigens, including gliadin, tissue transglutaminase, and epider -\nmal transglutaminase. Natural killer lymphocytes cause villous atrophy. Circulating IgA antibodies to TG2 and TG3 result from this process and are an index of the severity of the intestinal inflammatory response. These antibodies decrease with adherence to gluten restriction.",

We began this jour -\nney together in the mid-1980s having recognized a gap \nin the knowledge of practicing dermatologists and inter -\nnists. We have somewhat altered our approach with each \nnew edition and this one is no different. With this edition \nwe said farewell to Jean Bolognia as an editor and wel -\ncome Misha Rosenbach and Ruth Ann Vleugels. Misha \nis one of the first people to train in a combined derma -\ntology\u2013medicine residency in the United States and has \ndeveloped a focused interest in hospital medicine, with a \nspecific research focus on granulomatous diseases. Ruth \nAnn began and runs one of the most successful rheuma -\ntology\u2013dermatology clinics in the United States and has \nnow successfully trained multiple others in a postresiden -\ncy fellowship program. We have retained our collabora -\ntion with Warren Piette and John Zone.In this revision of our book we added some additional \nchapters and have selected many new authors and co-\nauthors to update and revise most of the chapters. We have \ncontinued our goal of providing the practicing physician, \nacademic physician, or resident with a text that explores \nthe relationship of the skin with internal diseases or con -\nditions. Each chapter now has been reviewed by one of  \nour associated editors as well as both of us. We continue \nour stance of providing suggested readings rather than an \nextensive reference list. These suggested readings have \nbeen updated so that the interested reader may delve \ninto the most current literature. We have continued the \nuse of color photographs throughout this edition of our \ntext and in many cases have found new photographs for \ninclusion.Preface",

They were first described in the fingernails \nof patients with severe hypoalbuminemia, some of whom \nalso had nephrotic syndrome, and resolved with normal -\nization of the serum albumin level. Muehrcke lines have \nsubsequently been reported in patients with liver disease, \nmalnutrition, chemotherapy, organ transplantation, and \nhuman immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodefi -\nciency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). These lines are associ -\nated with periods of metabolic stress; times at which the \nbody\u2019s capacity to synthesize proteins is diminished.\nHalf-and-half nails, also known as Lindsay nails, are \ncharacterized by a white band proximally, a pink or red-\nbrown band distally, and a sharp demarcation between \nthe two ( Fig. 44-7 ). They were originally described in \nassociation with chronic renal disease, and resolve with \ntransplantation, but do not resolve with hemodialysis \ntreatment or change in hemoglobin or albumin levels. \nHalf-and-half nails have subsequently been reported in \nassociation with Kawasaki disease, cirrhosis, Crohn\u2019s \ndisease, zinc deficiency, chemotherapy, Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease, \nand pellagra.\nHalf-and-half nails should be distinguished from  Terry \nnails. The latter are characterized by leukonychia involv -\ning more than 80% of the total nail length. Terry nails \nwere originally reported in association with cirrhosis, \nusually secondary to alcoholism, but have subsequently \nbeen found to be associated with congestive heart failure, \nadult-onset diabetes, pulmonary tuberculosis, reactive ar -\nthritis, older age, leprosy, and peripheral vascular disease.\nOnycholysis\nOnycholysis is a partial detachment of the nail plate from \nthe nail bed, which may be completely asymptomatic or \npainful. The most common cause is trauma (from long \nnails, nail cosmetics), but other causes include psoriasis, \ninfections (dermatophytes, Candida , bacteria), irritant or allergic contact dermatitis, lichen planus, and drug \n reactions. Less frequently, it is a sequela of a systemic \n disease, such as thyrotoxicosis, hypothyroidism, porphyria, \nRaynaud\u2019s disease, yellow nail syndrome, systemic infec -\ntion, or diabetes mellitus. In thyrotoxicosis, the nails are \ntypically undulated and curved upwards. With  psoriasis \nand psoriatic arthritis, onycholysis may be accompanied \nby pitting ( Fig. 44-3 ). When combined with ultraviolet \nlight, tetracyclines, captopril, chlorpromazine, thiazide \ndiuretics, oral contraceptives, and fluoroquinolones, may \nresult in photo-induced onycholysis. Photo-onycholysis is \nmost common in patients undergoing PUVA treatment \n(psoralens and UVA), but can be prevented by applying \ncolored varnishes to the nails prior to therapy.\nPeriungual and Distal Digit \nAbnormalities\nClubbing\nClubbing appears clinically as exaggerated transverse \nand longitudinal curvature of the nails along with en -\nlargement of the soft tissue structures of the fingertips. \nIt usually involves the thumb and/or index finger of both \nhands. There is a \u201cspongy\u201d feeling as pressure is applied \nto the proximal nail fold. Clubbing is defined mathemati -\ncally; in normal nails, the angle between the nail plate \nand the proximal nail fold (Lovibond\u2019s angle) is less than \n180\u00b0, usually about 160\u00b0, but in clubbing, this angle is \ngreater than 180\u00b0. Clubbing must be differentiated from \npseudoclubbing, which is an overcurvature of the nails \ntransversely and longitudinally, with a normal Lovi -\nbond\u2019s angle. While there are many methods to measure \nclubbing, the simplest way is to oppose the dorsal surfaces \nof symmetrical digits on each hand. In normal nails, the \nspace created by the distal interphalangeal joint and dis -\ntal fingertip is diamond-shaped, whereas it is absent with \nclubbed nails. The pathogenesis of clubbing is likely due \nto soft tissue fibrovascular hyperplasia between the ma -\ntrix and the periosteum.",

First-time mothers with sporadic PCT had an ex -\ncess risk of low birth weight and premature delivery.\nPseudoxanthoma Elasticum\nPseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), a rare inherited \nconnective tissue disorder caused by mutations in the  \nATP-binding cassette transporter C6 (ABCC6), results in \nprogressive degeneration of elastic fibers within the skin, \nretina, and cardiovascular system. Prevalence varies from \n1/70,000 to 1/160,000. There is a female predominance of \n2:1. Small yellow papules arise symmetrically on the lateral \nneck, antecubital and popliteal fossae, axillae, and ingui -\nnal and periumbilical skin. Oral and anogenital mucosae \nmay also be affected. Angioid streaks of the retina result \nfrom calcification of elastic fibers in Bruch\u2019s membrane. \nProgressive calcification of the elastic media and intima of \nblood vessels may manifest as decreased peripheral pulses, \ngastrointestinal hemorrhage, renal artery stenosis with hy -\npertension, and coronary artery disease/myocardial infarc -\ntion. Pregnancy may accelerate the vascular complications \nof PXE and is associated with an increased risk of gastro -\nintestinal hemorrhage. Additional risks include arterial hy -\npertension and thromboembolism. Placental insufficiency \nmay cause intrauterine growth retardation and increased \nspontaneous abortion. No increased rates of delivery com -\nplications have been reported.PRURITUS IN PREGNANCY\nPruritus has been reported in 18% of pregnancies in the \nabsence of any cutaneous or systemic pathology and most \ncommonly affects the scalp, genitalia, perianal skin, and \nabdomen especially in the third trimester. Before pruritus \nis attributed solely to pregnancy, pruritic dermatoses (i.e., \nAD, drug eruption, pityriasis rosea), cutaneous infections \n(i.e., pediculosis, scabies, dermatophytosis), and systemic \ncauses of generalized pruritus (i.e., lymphoma, HIV in -\nfection, hepatitis C virus infection, as well as hepatobili -\nary or renal dysfunction) should be excluded.

XLP exhibits the same childhood-onset and \nimmediate cutaneous photosensitivity as EPP, but may \nhave a higher risk of hepatic dysfunction.\nClinical Manifestations\nPhotocutaneous features of EPP and XLP are alike. Tin -\ngling, burning, and pruritus, elicited by only minutes to \nhours of sun exposure, are followed by photodistributed \nerythema and edema that slowly evolve into painful pur -\npuric mats that fade over several days. Repeated damage \ncan lead to indurated, weather-beaten, or cobblestoned \nskin, most often seen over the knuckles. Waxy induration, \nshallow elliptical scars, and perioral furrows are facial le -\nsions highly suggestive of EPP or XLP. Blistering and \ncrusting occur, but infrequently. In addition to the cuta -\nneous findings, early onset of gallstones and progressive \nhepatic dysfunction may complicate the clinical course.\nDiagnosis\nAbnormally high PP in erythrocytes, plasma, and feces is \ncharacteristic of both disorders; in XLP, erythrocyte zinc-\nPP may be 15\u201350% of the total PP present, whereas in EPP \nit is typically <85%. Because PP is not water-soluble, uri -\nnary porphyrins are typically normal, however, with suffi -\ncient liver dysfunction, coproporphyrinuria appears. Blood \nspecimens, especially plasma, must be completely protected \nfrom light during collection, transport, and processing be -\ncause PP is very photolabile. Mutation analysis is available \nfor both FECH  and ALAS2  genes. A hematology profile \nand liver function panel should be obtained at diagnosis and \nmonitored at 6- to 12-month intervals.

However, there is clearly a subset of patients who \nremain recalcitrant to the above-mentioned therapies. \nMany other systemic agents have been used for recalci -\ntrant cutaneous LE. Systemic corticosteroids are gener -\nally less effective for the cutaneous disease, despite their \ndramatic effect on systemic symptoms and signs. Doses \nrequired to maintain control of cutaneous disease typi -\ncally lead to steroid-related side effects; therefore, strong \nconsideration should be given to steroid-sparing agents. \nImmunosuppressants such as azathioprine, mycopheno -\nlate mofetil, and methotrexate have been reported to be \neffective in recalcitrant cases. Perhaps the most dramatic \nclinical response to treatment comes from thalidomide at \ndoses of 50 to 150 mg/day. Thalidomide prescribing is as -\nsociated with a program to prevent pregnancy (STEPS \nprogram), and the physician and pharmacy must be regis -\ntered with the company. In addition, there is real concern \nabout the possibility of thalidomide-induced peripheral \nneuropathy that may not be reversible upon cessation of \nthe drug as well as an increased risk of thrombotic events. \nA thalidomide analog, lenalidomide, has been reported to \nbe effective for recalcitrant disease and appears to carry a \nlower risk of neuropathy.\nAdditionally, several other cytotoxic/immunosuppres -\nsive agents have been used in individual patients with \nsome success. Dapsone 100 to 200 mg/day has been re -\nported to be effective. It may be helpful in the rare patient \nwith SCLE, in those with LE and cutaneous vasculitis \nsyndromes, and in individuals with bullous LE. High-\ndose intravenous immunoglobulin has provided good but \nshort-lived results in some patients. Apremilast, a newly \napproved agent for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, has \nbeen used in a small study of patients with cutaneous LE \nand might be another agent to consider in antimalarial-\nresistant patients.\nThere are several newer biological agents that have \nbeen approved or studied in systemic LE patients; how -\never, their benefit specifically for cutaneous disease is not \nyet known.

Therefore, \na fundamental understanding of nail unit anatomy is es -\nsential to appreciate nail abnormalities and their relation -\nship to systemic diseases ( Fig. 44-1 ). The nail apparatus is \ncomposed of a hard and durable nail plate that lies above \nthe nail bed and the distal portion of the nail matrix, \nwhich is seen distally as the white \u201chalf-moon\u201d-shaped \narea known as the lunula. The remaining part of the ma -\ntrix lies below the proximal nail fold. The undersurface \nof the proximal nail fold forms the eponychium (cuticle). \nThe nail bed lies beneath the nail plate and above the \ndistal phalanx. Due to its rich blood supply, the nail bed \nappears as a reddish area extending from the lunula to \nthe area just proximal to the free edge of the nail. The \nproximal and lateral nail folds border the nail plate, and \nthe hyponychium is the area under the free edge and the \ndistal portion of the nail plate. The blood supply to the \nnail arises from the superficial and deep palmar branches \nof the digital arteries.\nThe nail plate is hard and durable due to its composition \nof keratins and sulfur, the latter in the form of cysteine. \nThe mitotically active nail matrix forms the nail plate kera -\ntin. The proximal third of the matrix forms the upper third \nof the nail plate; the middle part of the matrix, the mid -\nportion; and the distal third of the matrix gives rise to the \nlower third of the plate. Therefore, by using knowledge of this anatomy, melanin in the nail plate may be traced back \nto its origin in either the distal or proximal matrix to guide \nan appropriate biopsy if necessary.\nA complete and detailed history and physical examina -\ntion of all 20 nails is essential in evaluating patients with \nsuspected manifestations of systemic disease. While some \nnail findings may be characteristic of certain diseases, \nothers may narrow the differential diagnosis, allowing an \nappropriate work-up to be initiated.\nANATOMIC CHANGES OF THE NAIL UNIT \n(TABLE 44-1 )\nNail Matrix and Plate Abnormalities\nBeau Lines\nBeau lines are transverse grooves in the nail plate that \narise due to temporary suppression of nail growth within \nthe nail matrix and occur during periods of acute/chronic \nstress and/or systemic illness ( Fig. 44-2 ). The precipi -\ntating event might be local trauma, paronychia, chemo -\ntherapeutic agents that are cytotoxic to the nail matrix, or \nabrupt onset of systemic disease. These grooves have also \nbeen described in association with rheumatic fever, ma -\nlaria, pemphigus, Raynaud\u2019s disease, and myocardial in -\nfarction, as well as following deep-sea dives. The distance \nof the Beau line from the proximal nail fold will give the \nclinician an estimate of the time of the acute stress, using \naverage growth rates of 3 mm/month for fingernails and \n1 mm/month for toenails.\nMees Lines\nMees lines are 1- to 2-mm wide horizontal parallel white \nbands (leukonychia striata), which span the width of the \nnail plate, usually affecting all fingernails. They are associ -\nated with arsenic poisoning in most instances and may be \nused to identify the time of poisoning, since they require \nabout 2 months to appear on the fingernails following the \ninitial insult. Mees lines have also been described in associ -\nation with numerous acute systemic stresses, such as acute \nrenal failure, congestive heart failure, ulcerative colitis, \nbreast cancer, infections such as measles and  tuberculosis, \nsystemic lupus erythematosus, and with exposure to other \ntoxic metals such as thallium. Leukonychia striata is also \ncommonly associated with trauma to the nail matrix, such \nas from manicuring.",

The diagnosis is established \nby identifying the bacteria in Warthin\u2013Starry-stained  \nhistologic sections or by PCR-based analysis of biopsy \nspecimens. Treatment consists primarily of first- and \nsecond-generation macrolides.\nFungal Infections\nCertain fungal infections, such as oral candidiasis \n(thrush), can serve as presenting signs of HIV infection \n(Fig. 35-12 ), whereas others, such as cryptococcosis, are \nseen late in the course of the disease. HIV-infected pa -\ntients are at increased risk for the development of su -\nperficial mucocutaneous fungal infections due to Candida  \nspp. and dermatophytes, as well as systemic infections \ndue to Cryptococcus neoformans , Candida  spp., and dimor -\nphic fungi (e.g., Histoplasma capsulatum , Coccidioides im -\nmitis , Penicillium marneffei ). The cutaneous lesions of \ncryptococcosis and dimorphic fungal infections are often \na mixture of indurated papules, plaques, and ulcerated \nlesions, and they sometimes resemble the dome-shaped \npapules of MC ( Fig. 35-13 ). Examination of a potassium \nhydroxide preparation of dermal scrapings or a periodic \nacid\u2013Schiff- or silver-stained histologic section allows a presumptive diagnosis, and a simultaneous tissue fungal \nculture provides a definitive diagnosis. Cryoptococcal \ncutaneous infections are often a sign of disseminated dis -\nease, and should prompt thorough multisystem evalua -\ntion including a lumbar puncture.\nInfections with tinea (dermatophytoses) affect three \nkeratin-containing structures, the skin, hair, and nails. \nHIV-infected patients are not only prone to the more \ncommon forms of tinea, e.g., tinea pedis, tinea man -\nuum (hand), tinea unguium (nails), and tinea corporis \n(Fig. 35-14 ), but they often have more severe or wide -\nspread lesions. These patients also develop an unusual \nform of tinea unguium known as proximal subungual \nonychomycosis. In the more common form of tinea \nunguium (distal subungual onychomycosis), the most \n pronounced dystrophic changes, e.g., thickening and \nyellow discoloration, are seen in the distal portions \nof the fingernails or toenails, whereas in the proximal \nform there is a white discoloration that first appears in \nthe proximal portion of the nail.

Schnitzler\u2019s syndrome (chronic \nurticarial lesions, intermittent fever, malaise, bone pain, arthralgia, and monoclonal IgM gammopathy) is another disorder with peculiar skin manifestations (\u201cneutrophilic urticaria\u201d) associated with paraproteinemia, possibly rep -\nresenting an autoinflammatory condition related to the paraproteinemia. POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, \norganomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy [M protein], and skin changes) and AESOP syndrome  \n(adenopathy and extensive skin patch overlying a plasma-cytoma), too, are almost always related to paraproteinemia. Type I cryoglobulinemia is due to a monoclonal protein (IgG, IgM, IgA, or rarely a light chain) that precipitates when cooled. It is usually seen in association with MGUS, Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s macroglobulinemia, multiple myeloma, or rarely other immunoglobulin-producing B-NHLs. Cutaneous lesions are usually characterized by purpuric lesions and/or hemorrhagic crusts and ulcerations in ar -\neas of small infarctions due to clotted vessels.

Although they do not metastasize, \nthey have led to death. Their infiltration into surrounding \nmuscle and fascia may require excision, which is technically \ndifficult because of poorly defined margins. Epidermal cysts \nand fibromas can be removed surgically if desired. There \nappears to be no increased risk of malignant degeneration \nin such lesions. Osteomas may be removed for cosmetic \npurposes.\nHamartomatous Polyposis Syndromes\nInherited hamartomatous polyposis syndromes are char -\nacterized by the presence of multiple hamartomatous \npolyps of the gastrointestinal tract and have an autosomal \ndominant mode of inheritance. Hamartomatous polyps \nare malformations of the intestinal mucosa that have un -\ndergone excessive growth.\nPeutz\u2013Jeghers syndrome consists of hamartomatous \npolyps in the gastrointestinal tract and mucocutane -\nous pigmentation of the lips, buccal mucosa, palms, and \nsoles. Lentigines of the lips, buccal mucosa, and dig -\nits may appear in infancy or early childhood. Multiple \nhamartomatous polyps are symptomatic and are com -\nmon in the small intestine. Gastrointestinal bleeding, \nobstruction, and intussusception are frequent complica -\ntions. Uncommon cases of carcinoma affecting the entire \ngastrointestinal tract warrant close surveillance. Ovar -\nian tumors and breast tumors have been reported with \nincreasing frequency in this syndrome. Women with \nPeutz\u2013 Jeghers syndrome should be followed closely for \nassociated ovarian and breast cancer. Once the diagnosis \nof Peutz\u2013 Jeghers syndrome is suspected, the gastroin -\ntestinal tract must be investigated with endoscopy  every \n2 years. Endoscopic or surgical removal of all polyps has \nbeen recommended. Screening for pancreatic cancer \nshould be considered. Peutz\u2013Jeghers syndrome is linked \nto mutations in the serine/threonine kinase STK11  gene, \nmapped to chromosome 19p13.3. Molecular testing of \nthe STK11  gene identifies most cases. It is inherited in an \nautosomal dominant manner.\nPhosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) hamartoma \ntumor syndrome (Cowden\u2019s syndrome) is associated with \nmultiple colorectal polyps. It is characterized by multiple \nhamartomas of the skin, mucous membranes, breast, and thyroid. Facial trichilemmomas are flesh-colored, elon -\ngated, verrucous papules in a periorificial and centrofacial \ndistribution. Papillomatosis is found on the labial, gingi -\nval, and buccal mucosae. Less common associations are \npalmoplantar keratoses, lipomas, hemangiomas, and neu -\nromas. Hamartomatous polyps may be present through -\nout the gastrointestinal tract.

If androgen deficiency \noccurs prior to puberty, the development of sexual hair \nand sebaceous and apocrine glands will be limited. Acne \nand androgenic alopecia do not occur. The skin shows \npallor, the penis is small, the scrotum is smooth, and fine \nwrinkling occurs around the eyes and lips. There is poor \nmuscle development, and delayed closure of the epiphy -\nses results in increased height.\nWith the development of androgen deficiency after \npuberty, sexual hair remains present but grows slowly. \nThe sebaceous glands atrophy, and acne will improve or \nclear. Vasomotor phenomena (hot flashes) may occur. All \nthe cutaneous manifestations of androgen deficiency are \nreversible with replacement therapy.\nAdrenogenital Syndromes\nAdrenogenital syndromes (congenital adrenal hyperpla -\nsia [CAH]) result from genetic defects in cortisol synthe -\nsis. Defective cortisol production stimulates release of \nACTH. Increased adrenal stimulation by ACTH, com -\nbined with a blocked cortisol production pathway, results \nin massive accumulation of adrenal androgens. This hy -\nperandrogenism causes virilization in females, sometimes \nresulting in ambiguous genitalia at birth, and sexual pre -\ncocity in males. Some of the genetic defects are associated \nwith salt wasting, hypovolemia, and death due to miner -\nalocorticoid deficiency.\nRoutine neonatal screening for 21-hydroxylase de -\nficiency (which accounts for >90% of cases of CAH) \nis available in many countries, including the United \nStates. Elevation of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (the sub -\nstrate of 21-hydroxylase) is diagnostic of this disorder, \nthough the test may be falsely negative. Some patients \nwith partial activity of 21-hydroxylase (nonclassic CAH) \nwill not be diagnosed by neonatal screening. Premature  \npubarche, accelerated growth, acne, and hirsutism \nmay prompt more in-depth screening during ado -\nlescence or adulthood. Measurement of the plasma \n17- hydroxyprogesterone level before and after admin -\nistration of high-dose ACTH may allow detection of \npatients with partial 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Those \nwith 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency (which accounts \nfor <10% of CAH cases) present similarly, either at \nbirth or later in childhood or adolescence, and exhibit \nelevated 11-deoxycortisol levels.\nThe treatment of CAH is initial glucocorticoid ad -\nministration to suppress completely ACTH secretion, \nfollowed by maintenance glucocorticoid doses that \ncontrol the level of cortisol precursors. Surgery may be \nrequired to match the phenotypic sexual characteristics to the genotypic sex; psychosocial support is another \nimportant facet of treatment of this condition.\nDISORDERS OF STEROID HORMONE \nRECEPTORS\nReceptors for glucocorticoids, androgens, and other ste -\nroid hormones form a family of related proteins. These \nreceptors contain a domain responsible for steroid \nhormone binding and a domain responsible for DNA \nbinding and effector function. Genetic defects in both \nthe glucocorticoid and androgen receptors have been \ndescribed.\nIn male patients with familial glucocorticoid resis -\ntance, cutaneous findings have not been described; female \npatients may develop hirsutism, androgenic alopecia, and \nmenstrual abnormalities. Both sexes have hypercorti -\nsolism and elevated ACTH levels without other features \nassociated with Cushing syndrome. Laboratory abnor -\nmalities may also include hypertension and hypokalemic \nacidosis. Virilization is the result of elevated adrenal an -\ndrogen levels secondary to chronic ACTH overstimula -\ntion.",

Subsequently, the leptomeningeal vessels \ndevelop into venous angiomas with a network of thin-\nwalled ectatic venules filling the subarachnoid space. At \nbirth, the PWS is flat and grows in proportion to the \ngrowth of the child. The cerebral angiomas develop pro -\ngressive loss of venous drainage with subsequent venous \nstasis and calcification. Calcification is believed to be the \nresult of deposition of colloid fibers on a matrix of reticu -\nlin fibers with precipitation of calcium salts on reticulin \nfibers. This calcification increases throughout life. The \ncombination of vascular ectasia and calcification then \nproduces ischemia of underlying cerebral tissue with re -\nsultant diffuse cortical atrophy and the resultant nervous \nsystem abnormalities.\nClinical Manifestations\nPWSs are a common type of vascular malformation,  \noccurring in 0.3% of newborn infants. They appear as \nflat, vascular lesions ranging in color from pink to deep \npurple. The lesion consists of dilated and excessively \nnumerous but well-defined capillaries in the dermis. As \nPWSs age, the vessel walls become progressively more \nectatic, producing exophytic blueberry-like ectasias in \nmid-adult life. By the fifth decade, over 50% of patients \nwith a facial PWS have hypertrophy and nodularity with -\nin the lesion. In SWS, the PWS is most commonly pres -\nent in the distribution of the first or second division of the \ntrigeminal nerve.\nLeptomeningeal vascular malformations, also called \nleptomeningeal angiomatosis, occur in 8% to 20% of cas -\nes when a typical facial PWS is present. Although any part \nof the cerebrum can be involved, the parietal and occipital \nareas are most commonly affected. When there is a uni -\nlateral PWS, the leptomeningeal angiomatosis tends to be \nipsilateral. Seizures are the most common CNS feature. \nEpilepsy develops in 75% to 80% of patients with SWS. \nSeizures may begin shortly after birth but usually occur \nin late infancy or early childhood. Seizures frequently \nbegin with febrile episodes that precipitate contralateral \nfocal motor seizures. Generalized seizures develop later. \nStroke-like episodes occur in patients with SWS, present -\ning as transient hemiparesis or visual field defects. Hemi -\nparesis, hemiplegia, hemisensory defects, homonymous \nhemianopsia, and limb atrophy may occur. Headaches are \nalso a common symptom in patients with SWS.\nCognitive impairment may be minimal in early child -\nhood but is progressive after the onset of seizures. Fac -\ntors associated with developmental delay include bilateral \ncerebral lesions, the extent of cerebral atrophy, the pres -\nence of refractory epilepsy, and the presence of multiple \ntypes of seizures. Some evidence points to the possibility \nthat seizures may inhibit blood flow resulting in increased \nneurological impairment. Control of seizures by medical \nor surgical means may slow the progression of the mental \ndefect. Behavioral problems also occur in patients with \nSWS. Lower cognitive function, epilepsy, and greater \nfrequency of seizures are associated with more psycho -\nlogical problems.Ocular involvement occurs in about 60% of patients \nwith SWS. Glaucoma is the most serious ocular problem \nand occurs in 30% to 70% of cases. The risk of glaucoma \nis highest in the first decade of life. Involvement of the \nPWS of both lids of the affected eye is usually associ -\nated with glaucoma. Capillary-venous malformations of \nthe choroid may produce glaucoma or retinal detachment \nthat may be congenital or may occur later in life.

Patients \ncan also be diagnosed by histologic examination of the \npapulosquamous lesions, which shows dermal infiltrates \nof lymphocytes and plasma cells; a silver or immunohis -\ntochemical stain is required to detect the spirochetes. A \ndark-field examination of the serous exudate of condy -\nloma lata can be performed, but requires exclusion of sap -\nrophytic treponemes (see below).\nAs with chancres, the lesions of secondary syphilis re -\nsolve spontaneously, i.e., even in the absence of appropri -\nate therapy, after 2 to 4 months. In a minority (25%) of \npatients, the cutaneous eruption recurs a second or third \ntime, but always in a transient manner. Those patients \nwho fail to receive appropriate therapy ( Table 35-1 ) may \nenter the next phase of the disease, which is referred to \nas latent syphilis. Although there are no clinical signs or \nsymptoms, latent syphilis is divided into early (<1 year) \nand late (>1 year) stages, and treatment recommendations \ndo differ ( Table 35-1 ).\nTertiary Syphilis\nOnly about a third of patients with latent syphilis eventu -\nally develop tertiary disease. In order of frequency, the \nmost common sites of clinically apparent involvement are \nthe skin (15% of untreated patients), cardiovascular sys -\ntem (10%), and central nervous system (5%). Given the \nnumber of untreated patients and the percentage of those \nwho develop symptomatic disease of the skin, one can see \nwhy cutaneous tertiary syphilis is quite rare, especially in \ndeveloped countries. There are two major types of cuta -\nneous disease: granulomatous (nodular or psoriasiform) \nand gummatous. Thick, dusky, red plaques and nodules \nare seen in the former and often resemble other granulo -\nmatous diseases, such as sarcoidosis. The combination of \nexpansion plus central scar formation leads to the char -\nacteristic figurate lesions. There is more necrosis within \ngummas and, as a result, destruction of adjacent tissues \ncan occur, including cartilage and bone. The RPR may \nbe negative during tertiary syphilis.\nCongenital Syphilis\nCongenital syphilis is classically divided into an early \nphase (<2 years of age) and a late phase (>2 years of age). \nHowever, it is equally important to distinguish between \nclinical signs and symptoms due to active infection as op -\nposed to stigmata that are sequelae of an in utero infec -\ntion. Because congenital syphilis represents a bloodborne \ninfection with T. pallidum , there is no primary phase. \nMany of the cutaneous manifestations of early congenital \nsyphilis are reminiscent of secondary syphilis, except that \nthe \u201cpapulosquamous\u201d lesions can be bullous and tend \nto be more erosive. Additional clinical manifestations \ninclude \u201csnuffles\u201d (bloody or purulent mucinous nasal \ndischarge), perioral and perianal fissures, hepatospleno -\nmegaly, and osteochondritis. Manifestations of the late \nphase include gummas, interstitial keratitis, and neuro -\nsyphilis (usually asymptomatic).\nThe later in pregnancy treatment is begun, the more \nlikely it is that the infant, although cured, may have the \nstigmata of an in utero infection. The most common stigmata (>50% of patients) involve either the facial \nbones or the dentition: frontal bossing, short maxillae, \nhigh palatal arch, saddle nose, Hutchinson\u2019s teeth (per -\nmanent upper central incisors that are widely spaced and \nbroader at the base), and mulberry molars (multiple small \ncusps rather than four well-formed cusps in the first low -\ner molar). Some of the \u201cclassic\u201d stigmata are seen much \nless commonly, e.g., the complete Hutchinson\u2019s triad \n(Hutchinson\u2019s teeth, interstitial keratitis, and eighth-\nnerve deafness), rhagades (periorificial linear scars from \nprevious fissures), saber shins, and Higoum\u00e9nakis\u2019 sign \n(unilateral thickening of the sternoclavicular portion of \nthe clavicle).\nDiagnosis\nDirect Testing .",

Vasculitic processes may be associated with infections, \ndrugs, malignancies, or connective tissue diseases (CTDs). \nIn the absence of an underlying disease we refer to them \nas primary or idiopathic systemic vasculitides. These condi -\ntions exhibit a wide spectrum of manifestations  depending \non the localization and size of the involved vessels, and of -\nten have overlapping clinical and pathologic manifestations. \nWhen skin vessels are affected we talk about cutaneous vas -\nculitis (CV). CV may be a process confined exclusively to \nthe skin, or a manifestation of a more widespread entity as -\nsociated with a variable grade of visceral involvement.\nNOMENCLATURE AND CLASSIFICATION \nCRITERIA\nClassification of vasculitis has been a challenging prob -\nlem for decades. A widely accepted set of diagnostic cri -\nteria for the vasculitides has never been established. To \nfill this void classification criteria were developed to cre -\nate homogeneous cohorts for clinical research. There are \ntwo classification schemes that have been proposed. One \ndeveloped in 1990 by the American College of Rheuma -\ntology (ACR) and one developed by a consensus confer -\nence of multiple specialists held in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, known as the Chapel Hill Consensus Confer -\nence (CHCC). The CHCC classification was initially \npublished in 1994 and a 2012 revision was published in \nJanuary 2013 ( Table 4-1 ). Dermatologists were not in -\nvolved in the development of any of these classifications \nsystems and thus there are some entities seen on the skin \nthat are not included and there are some nuances regard -\ning cutaneous involvement that might be seen differently \nby the dermatologic community. The CHCC deals with \nand tries to define noninfectious vasculitides.\nIn view of different classification and definition schemes, \nvasculitis of the skin has been referred to over time by  using \na number of terms, namely, hypersensitivity vasculitis, leu -\nkocytoclastic angiitis, and more recently single-organ cuta -\nneous small-vessel vasculitis (SoCSVV). SoCSVV refers to \na vasculitis confined to the skin with no features suggesting \na limited expression of a systemic vasculitis.\nNevertheless, three major groups of systemic vascu -\nlitides could be identified in all classification schemes: \nlarge-vessel vasculitis (giant cell arteritis and Takayasu),  \n medium-sized vessel vasculitis (polyarteritis nodosa \n[PAN] and Kawasaki), and small-sized vessel vasculitis. \nWithin this latter group we can identify disorders associ -\nated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), \ndisorders associated with immune complex deposition, \nand Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura characterized by IgA \ndominant immune deposits, among others.\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\nIn Norwich, UK, the reported annual incidence of  biopsy-  \nproven CV in a population 16 years of age and older was \n38.6 per million. In northwestern Spain, in a popula -\ntion 21 years of age and older it was 55.2 per million. In \n Olmsted County, Minnesota, USA, the incidence rate \nwas 45 per million considering all age groups.\nIn reports from the United States, Malaysia, and \n Kuwait, men and women were affected almost equally. In \nseries reported from the United Kingdom and Singapore, \nfemales outnumbered males in a ratio of approximately \n2:1. In contrast, in series reported from northwestern \nSpain and Australia males outnumbered females in a ratio \nof approximately 2:1.\nIn series of adult patients reported from Spain and Ku -\nwait, CV as an idiopathic process limited to the skin ac -\ncounted for 32% and 36.8% of cases, respectively. In these \nseries, CV was a manifestation of a primary  systemic vascu -\nlitis (PSV), other than hypersensitivity vasculitis, in 22% of \npatients from Spain and 12.2% from Kuwait.",

Cutaneous lesions are useful for \nhistopathologic examination and fungal culture. The \nquickest way to diagnose cutaneous blastomycosis is with \na potassium hydroxide preparation performed on mate -\nrial scraped from pustules or dark punctae that stud the \nlesional verrucous surfaces. One looks for yeast with a \ncharacteristic broad-based budding.\nTreatment\nPulmonary disease is treated with amphotericin B. Lim -\nited cutaneous disease may be treated with oral itracon -\nazole. Treatment duration is guided by the extent of \ndissemination and the patient\u2019s immune status. Blastomy -\ncosis occurs in immunocompromised patients less often \nthan the endemic mycoses.\nPARACOCCIDIOIDOMYCOSIS\nParacoccidioidomycosis, also called South American blas -\ntomycosis, is restricted to Central and South America, \nwhere it usually presents with a tuberculosis-like pul -\nmonary syndrome accompanied by cervical adenitis and \ngranulomatous oral lesions. Estrogen seems to suppress \nvirulence factors, so in people aged 10 to 50 years, it is seen \nalmost exclusively in males. AIDS patients have a particu -\nlarly troublesome course.\nOPPORTUNISTIC FUNGAL INFECTIONS\nOpportunistic fungal infections are most commonly \ncaused by two groups of yeasts ( Candida  and Cryptococ -\ncus) and two groups of molds (Mucorales and Aspergil -\nlus). These organisms\u2014and hundreds of other fungal \nspecies\u2014are found worldwide, yet cause significant dis -\nease almost exclusively in severely immunocompromised \npatients, especially those with AIDS, hematologic ma -\nlignancies, or high-dose corticosteroid and/or cytotoxic \ntherapy.\nCRYPTOCOCCOSIS\nCryptococcosis is a systemic infection caused by closely \nrelated species, Cryptococcus neoformans  and Cryptococcus \ngattii . The organisms are nearly ubiquitous in nature, \nsubsisting on bird guano, and cause human disease world -\nwide, typically by inhalational means.\nClinical Manifestations\nCryptococcosis produces a pneumonia-like illness con -\nsisting of dyspnea and fever. Severe central nervous sys -\ntem manifestations are common in AIDS patients as both  initial\u2014and terminal\u2014presentations. Cutaneous lesions are \nrelatively common but are difficult to diagnose clinically  \nbecause of diverse clinical morphology. AIDS patients with \ndisseminated disease may have abundant, monomorphous, \numbilicated, skin-colored to slightly hypopigmented,  \nfacial papules. This appearance resembles molluscum  \ncontagiosum, a poxvirus infection that is common in AIDS \npatients. Other opportunistic mycoses (histoplasmosis and \nP. marneffei  infection) may also present with molluscum-\nlike papules. Another common presentation in immuno -\nsuppressed patients, called cryptococcal cellulitis, consists \nof large, indurated, red patches and plaques ( Fig. 33-7 ).\nDiagnosis\nCryptococcal antigen tests are available for both blood \nand cerebrospinal fluid. In tissue, Cryptococcus  can be \nidentified with mucicarmine stain, which accentuates the \nyeast\u2019s capsule but does not stain other fungi with similar \nhistologic morphology; bedside diagnostic tests including \nskin touch preps with India ink may rapidly identify this \npathogen. Because skin involvement is mostly the result \nof dissemination, one must identify and treat other foci, \nparticularly the central nervous system.\nTreatment\nThe treatment of choice for cryptococcal meningoencepha -\nlitis is systemic amphotericin B combined with flucytosine. \nFluconazole is a useful prophylaxis in HIV patients with pri -\nor cryptococcal meningoencephalitis. In milder, noncentral \nnervous system disease, prolonged fluconazole therapy may \nbe required.\nMUCORMYCOSIS\nMucormycosis is caused by opportunistic pathogens from \nRhizopus , Absidia , Mucor , and related genera.

In the management of DIHS prompt with -\ndrawal of the offending drug is vital. The role of systemic \ncorticosteroids is controversial but generally in patients \nwith visceral involvement or severe symptoms, treatment \nwith prednisone (1 to 2 mg/kg per day) is usually ensued; \npatients often require months of systemic corticosteroid \ntreatment (50 days on average). Antihistamines and topi -\ncal corticosteroids have also been used to alleviate symp -\ntoms.

Drug-induced ur -\nticaria represents approximately 5% of all cutaneous drug \neruptions. The majority (80%) of cases of new-onset urti -\ncaria resolve in 2 weeks and >95% resolve within 3 months.\nComplex Urticarial: Serum Sickness-Like \nReaction\nTrue \u201cserum sickness\u201d is a probable immune complex \nmediated (Arthus) reaction that occurs when antibody\u2013\nantigen complexes deposit and activate a complement \ncascade. Tissue damage follows. In contrast \u201cserum \nsickness-like reactions\u201d (SSLRs) do not exhibit immune \ncomplexes, hypocomplementemia, vasculitis, or renal le -\nsions that are seen with a true serum sickness reaction. \nAn SSLR is characterized by cutaneous eruption that is \nusually urticarial sometimes morbilliform, which may fa -\nvor distal extremities with lesions prominent over joints \n(Fig. 47-4 ), malaise, low-grade fever, and arthralgias. \nLymphadenopathy and eosinophilia may be present. \nSSLRs usually occur 1 to 3 weeks after drug exposure and \nresolve soon after drug discontinuation.\nEpidemiologic data on SSLRs are scarce but this \nreaction is known to occur more often in infants and \nchildren. The estimated pooled incidence of cefaclor-\nrelated SSLRs has been calculated in the range 0.02% \nto 0.2% per drug course in pediatric patients. Studies have also suggested that the risk of SSLR is greater \nwith cefaclor than with any other antibiotic therapy \nincluding other cephalosporins. However, bacterial \nresistance to cefaclor has reduced its use in pediatric \ninfections and therefore SSLR may be less common \nthan it was in the past. Other drugs that have been im -\nplicated include biological agents (efalizumab, omali -\nzumab, rituximab, infliximab), antibiotics (cefuroxime, \ncefazolin, meropenem, minocycline, ciprofloxacin, \nrifampicin), antimycotics (griseofulvin, itraconazole), \nand other agents such as bupropion, clopidogrel, fluox -\netine, insulin detemir, immunoglobulin, mesalamine, \nor streptokinase.\nSSLR is a self-limiting disease that subsides within 2 to \n3 weeks after discontinuation of the causative agent.

A team approach with the inter -\nnist, ophthalmologist, pulmonologist, and dermatologist \nis required. A careful history and physical examination \nshould be performed, focusing on all organ systems, but \nwith preference given to the lungs, eyes, nervous system, \nheart, and skin.

Given the potential association of sarcoidosis \nwith thyroid disease, screening for thyroid function test -\ning is reasonable.\nPROGNOSIS\nMortality rates in sarcoidosis vary from 3% to 6%. Car -\ndiac disease (the most common cause in Japan), progres -\nsive pulmonary disease (the most common cause in the \nUnited States), and neurosarcoidosis have been the cause \nof death in some patients.\nThe morbidity in sarcoidosis can be severe. Blindness \ncan result from untreated ocular disease, and pulmonary \ndisease can cause debilitating fatigue and shortness of \nbreath, sometimes requiring oxygen supplementation \nor, in severe cases, lung transplantation. Renal failure re -\nquiring dialysis has been reported from granulomatous \ninvolvement of the kidney, calcium deposits, and chronic \nurinary tract stones. Cosmetic deformities may occur in \npatients with cutaneous sarcoidosis, particularly in those \nwith lupus pernio. Although many patients with pulmo -\nnary sarcoidosis may have resolution of their disease, the rates vary with the stage of pulmonary disease. Stage I \nsarcoidosis resolves in roughly 60% of patients; stage II \nresolves in 40% of patients; and stage III resolves in only \n12%.\nDespite the aberrations noted in tests of cell-medi -\nated immunity, untreated sarcoidosis is not associated \nwith an increased number of infections. However, it has \nbeen linked to an increase in the frequency of malignan -\ncy, although some recent meta-analyses have cast doubt \non these associations and suggest there may not be an \nincreased risk of malignancy in patients with sarcoid -\nosis. Prior studies had suggested an increased risk of \nskin cancers (nonmelanoma and melanoma), and several \nstudies have reported an increased incidence of hemato -\nlogic malignancy\u2014i.e., lymphoma, leukemia, and solid \ntumors (i.e., lung, testes, skin). Of note is that smoking \nhas been associated with a reduced risk of developing \npulmonary sarcoidosis because of its ability to impair \nthe pulmonary immune function, but for obvious rea -\nsons patients should not be encouraged to smoke.

Noteworthy, the clini -\ncal spectrum is broader in adults. Blanco et al. (1998 ) \n retrospectively reviewed 303 consecutive patients with CV: \n172 adults and 131 children ( \u226420 years). Fourteen children \nwere classified as having hypersensitivity  vasculitis (10.7%), \nand 116 as having Henoch- Sch\u00f6nlein  purpura (88.5%), \nrepresenting the most frequent  vasculitic condition associ -\nated with CV in this age group. Therefore, almost 100% of \nchildren with CV had one of these two conditions.\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\nGeneral Concepts\nCutaneous lesions seen in CV are correlated with the size \nof the affected vessel. Small-sized blood vessels gener -\nally include capillaries, post-capillary venules, and non -\nmuscular arterioles (diameter <50 \u03bcm). These are mainly \n localized within the superficial papillary dermis. The pat -\ntern of skin involvement when cutaneous small vessels are \naffected is usually a maculopapular rash followed by pal -\npable purpura ( Fig. 4-1 ), resulting from extravasation of \nerythrocytes through damaged blood vessel walls into the \ndermis. These lesions, in contrast to simple purpura, do \nnot blanch when pressure is  applied to the skin. Other skin \nlesions such as nonpalpable macules and patches,  urticaria, \nbullous lesions, vesicles, pustules, splinter hemorrhages, \nand ulcerations may also be seen ( Fig. 4-2 ). Moreover, a \ncombination of different lesions is common. Because of \nincreased hydrostatic pressure, skin lesions are common -\nest on the legs and buttocks.  Medium-sized blood vessels \n(diameter between 50 and 150 \u03bcm) have muscular walls \nand are located principally in the deep  reticular  dermis, \nnear the junction of the dermis and subcutaneous tis -\nsues.

An important feature of TEN is the presentation of painful erythematous skin (Fig. 11-6) that progresses to denudation (Fig. 11-7).\nRecovery from skin sloughing is slow, but it may be \ncomplete without scarring if excellent care is adminis -\ntered early in the disease course. Mortality is mainly from multiorgan failure secondary to sepsis. TEN mortality is predicted from the verified SCORTEN tool. One point is given for each clinical or biochemical risk factor, which \nincludes: age >40  years, heart rate >120 beats per minute, \ncomorbid malignancy, affected body surface area >10%, \nblood urea nitrogen >28  mg/dL, glucose >252  mg/dL, and \nbicarbonate <20  mEq/L. Mortality increases with points; \n3.2% prediction for 0 or 1 point, 35.3% for 3 points, and up to 90% with 5 points or more.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThe differential diagnosis of EM, SJS, and TEN must be divided into two categories: a differential for the cutaneous eruption and one for the mucosal lesions, which may occur alone. Erosive mucosal diseases include pemphigus vulgaris (histopathology showing acantholysis, with confirmatory direct and indirect immunohistochemistry), paraneoplastic pemphigus (diagnostic immunohistochemistry), herpetic gingivostomatitis (histopathology showing multinucleated giant cells, a diagnostic culture), recurrent aphthous sto-matitis (morphology and time course of lesions suggesting diagnosis), cicatricial pemphigoid (histopathology showing dermoepidermal junction blister and confirmatory direct immunofluorescence), erosive lichen planus (diagnostic histopathology), graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (sug-gestive if history includes transplantation, but indistin -\nguishable on histopathology).\nThe differential diagnosis of the cutaneous lesions of \nEM is extensive, particularly if the skin lesions are not typ -\nical targets. Patients with typical EM with target lesions may have other cutaneous lesions that are clinicopatho-logically similar to those of simple erythema, urticaria, annular erythemas, viral exanthemas, secondary syphilis, toxic shock, or the following vasculitides: cutaneous small-vessel (leukocytoclastic) vasculitis, pustular vasculitis (dis -\nseminated gonococcemia or meningococcemia, or lesions of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s or bowel bypass syndromes), or vasculitis as -\nsociated with collagen\u2013  vascular diseases.

Antinuclear antibody \nis positive in approximately two\u00adthirds of cases. Newer \nserologic studies, including myositis\u00adspecific autoanti \u00ad\nbodies, have become available, and include Jo\u00ad1, Mi\u00ad2, \nPL\u00ad7, PL\u00ad12, EJ, OJ, KS, Zo, YRS, and SRP .

Anti\u00adMJ and \u00adPMS1 have \nbeen found to correlate to cases of juvenile dermatomy \u00ad\nositis, and the p155/140 antibody has also been associ \u00ad\nated and may correlate with more extensive cutaneous \ninvolvement in children. Although these tests correlate \nwith subsets of patients, the correlations are imperfect. \nFor example, anti\u00adJo\u00ad1 antibodies are linked to pulmo \u00ad\nnary disease and the antisynthetase syndrome, yet are \nnot uniformly present in these circumstances. In patients \nwith clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis, MDA\u00ad5, or \nanti\u00adCADM\u00ad140, autoantibodies may be present. Cuta \u00ad\nneous manifestations seen in patients with MDA\u00ad5 au \u00ad\ntoantibodies include palmar papules as well as cutaneous \nulcerations. Most recently, it has been demonstrated that \nmost patients with cancer\u00adassociated dermatomyositis \nhave antibodies to either transcription intermediary fac \u00ad\ntor 1 \u03b3 (TIF\u00ad1 \u03b3) or nuclear matrix protein NXP\u00ad2. These \nnovel autoantibodies may allow for a redefined classifica \u00ad\ntion of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies.\nCurrently, widespread use of autoantibody testing is \ndiscouraged because it neither confirms nor excludes the \ndiagnosis, is an imperfect predictor of the prognosis, and \nis not helpful in monitoring therapy. The novel autoan \u00ad\ntibodies may, however, help identify patients requiring \nmore aggressive malignancy or pulmonary work\u00adup and \nsurveillance in the future.\nA subsequent evaluation is necessary following the \ninitiation of therapy. Repeat testing of each abnormality \nis advised. Follow\u00adup of the myositis generally includes \na combination of the clinical examination and serial se \u00ad\nrum muscle enzyme testing. Repeat muscle biopsy or \nelectromyography is reserved for unusual circumstances. \nThe use of biomechanical assessment to quantify muscle \nstrength may be of benefit in following a patient\u2019s course. \nCareful questioning with regard to new symptoms should \noccur at each follow\u00adup visit, and if a symptom develops, \ncareful evaluation is necessary.\nCOURSE AND TREATMENT\nSeveral general measures are helpful in treating patients \nwith dermatomyositis and polymyositis. Bed rest may be \nrequired in those with progressive weakness; however, \nthis must be combined with an aggressive but passive \nrange\u00adof\u00admotion exercise program to prevent contrac \u00ad\ntures. Any patient with muscle disease should have an \nappropriate physical therapy regimen, and exercise and \nrehabilitation have been demonstrated to be beneficial, \nwithout inducing flares of the myositis, even in the course \nof active disease. Nutrition is important because of the \nnegative nitrogen balance that exists in inflammatory \nmyopathy. This is particularly important in children. Pa \u00ad\ntients who have evidence of dysphagia should have the \nhead of the bed elevated and should avoid eating meals \nbefore retiring.\nThe overall therapeutic plan is determined primar \u00ad\nily by the presence or absence of myositis or other in \u00ad\nternal organ involvement. The mainstay of therapy for \nmyositis is the use of systemic corticosteroids.",

Xanthomas, especially the tendinous and tuberous \ntypes, are prominent, and there is a significant increase in \nthe incidence of coronary artery disease, often beginning \nin early adulthood.\nElevated IDLs\nPatients with high levels of cholesterol and TGs, car \u00ad\nried in remnant lipoproteins (IDLs), have type III or \nbroad\u00ad \u03b2 disease (familial dysbetalipoproteinemia). Type \nIII hyperlipoproteinemia is inherited as an autosomal \ndominant disease, although similar remnant lipoprotein \naccumulation in the plasma has been seen as a secondary \nphenomenon in hypothyroidism and multiple myeloma. \nThe disorder appears to be related to a defect in the re \u00ad\nmoval of these remnants from the circulation. Clinically, \npatients with broad\u00ad \u03b2 disease are usually obese, glucose\u00ad \nintolerant, and have cutaneous xanthomas and athero \u00ad\nsclerotic disease.\nSecondary Hyperlipoproteinemias\nThe majority of cases of xanthomatosis are secondary, \nrather than the primary familial disorders listed in Table \n26\u00ad1 . Secondary hyperlipidemias result from disease in \nvarious organs (e.g., liver, kidney, thyroid, or pancreas) \nand are caused by a disturbance in the metabolism of \nTGs and cholesterol ( Table 26\u00ad2 ). Eruptive xanthomas \nmay appear when hypertriglyceridemia develops in pa \u00ad\ntients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and in patients \nwith the nephrotic syndrome. Tuberous and eruptive \nxanthomas can be seen in patients with hypothyroidism, \nbut only rarely. Infants with biliary atresia and adults with \nbiliary cirrhosis may develop any of the four types of xan \u00ad\nthoma ( Figs. 26\u00ad1 and 26\u00ad2 ). Diffuse plane xanthomas are  \nassociated primarily with malignancies of the reticulo \u00ad\nendothelial system, including multiple myeloma and \nlymphoma. Associated dyslipoproteinemias have been \nreported and attributed to complexes between the lipo \u00ad\nproteins and paraproteins.\nNormolipemic Xanthomatosis\nXanthomas may occur in disorders with histiocytic prolif \u00ad\nerations and secondary uptake of fat, rather than with an \nerror of lipid metabolism. Blood lipid levels are normal in \nthese disorders, which include nevoxanthoendothelioma, \nxanthoma disseminatum, cerebrotendinous xanthomato \u00ad\nsis, and verruciform xanthoma.\nNevoxanthoendothelioma, also known as juvenile \nxanthogranuloma, is a benign proliferation of lipid\u00adladen \nhistiocytes that occurs primarily in infancy and is usually \ncharacterized by one or a few nodules that are yellow\u00ad\nbrown and vary from a few millimeters to several centi \u00ad\nmeters in diameter. They are especially common on the \nscalp, face, or extensor extremities, and although they \nusually disappear spontaneously over several months, \nthey may persist for many years. Involvement of vis \u00ad\nceral organs is rare, but the lesions may occur in the iris \nand ciliary body of the eye, and in the lung, heart, and  \noropharynx.Xanthoma disseminatum is a rare and unusual disease \ncharacterized by xanthomatous nodules in the axillae, the \nantecubital and popliteal fossae, the intertriginous areas, \nand the oropharynx and upper respiratory tract.

Al -\nthough thrombocytopenic hemorrhage may occur any -\nwhere, typically it is increased in dependent areas or at \nsites of minor trauma.\nIntravascular Pressure Spikes. Petechial hemorrhage \nmay also result from strong or repetitive localized in -\ncreases in intravascular pressure. For example, straining \nduring childbirth may produce petechial hemorrhage above the clavicles, solely from the vigorous Valsalva-like pressure effects. This can also occur with vigorous repetitive coughing or retching. In children, vigorous crying may produce a similar supraclavicular distribution of petechial hemorrhage. Ligature placement or strangu-lation may also produce distinctive patterns of petechial hemorrhage.\nMinimally Inflammatory Microvascular Syndromes . \nThere are a variety of minimally inflammatory syndromes \naffecting the very smallest dermal vessels, which may re -\nsult in petechial hemorrhage, most included within the syndromes of the chronic pigmented purpuras and be -\nnign hypergammaglobulinemic purpura of Waldenstr\u00f6m (see Vascular Causes, below).\nPlatelet function is also important. Intravascular \nhemorrhage associated with normal platelet counts may \n result from congenital or hereditary platelet function de -\nfects. More commonly encountered are acquired plate -\nlet function defects, especially those caused by drugs or metabolic abnormalities, such as severe renal or hepatic impairment. Another type of acquired platelet function defect occurs in patients with monoclonal gammopathies in which there may be interference with normal plate -\nlet function by the protein. Finally, patients with myelo -\nproliferative disease and thrombocytosis in the range of 1,000,000/mm\n3 will often have platelet dysfunction, and \nsuch patients may have problems with both hemorrhage and thrombosis.\nCoagulation Cascade Problems in Hemostasis. The \nability to form a normal platelet plug is the most im -\nportant factor for normal hemostasis in the small  vessels  \nthat supply the skin. The coagulation cascade system be -\ncomes important as the diameter of the vessel  increases,  and increasing forces of pressure and flow require re -\ninforcement of the platelet plug by fibrin clots. This  \nexplains why patients with hemophilia or other pro -\ncoagulant deficiencies of the coagulation cascade sys -\ntem usually do not present with spontaneous petechial \nhemorrhage. Instead, they present with relatively mi -\nnor trauma-related injury of larger vessels in skin, fat,  \njoint, or muscle, with the development of an overlying ecchymosis.\nOther Intravascular Causes of Hemorrhage. Petechiae \nmay develop in nondependent areas as a result of abrupt \nincreases in capillary and postcapillary venule pressure. Forceful and repetitive Valsalva-like maneuvers, such as paroxysmal vomiting, violent coughing, or straining dur -\ning childbirth, can cause petechial hemorrhage in supra -\nclavicular areas even in patients whose platelet number and function are normal.\nThe Gardner\u2013Diamond syndrome, or psychogenic \npurpura, is sometimes included in discussions of in -\ntravascular causes of hemorrhage. Whether this syn -\ndrome results from more than factitious disease remains suspect.\nVascular Causes\nVascular causes of hemorrhage include both inflamma -\ntory and noninflammatory disorders.\nInflammatory Causes . Inflammatory hemorrhage should  \ninclude only those disorders in which vessel-directed in -\nflammation is evident. Perivascular inflammation that is \nnot vessel-directed should not be considered vasculitis, \nand it does not result in palpable purpura, the  hallmark \nbut not universal lesion of inflammatory hemorrhage. Lesions of palpable purpura are characterized by a port-wine color, incomplete blanching on pressure or dias -\ncopy, and palpability ( Fig. 15-2). Partial blanching of an \nearly lesion is an important physical finding, with ery -\nthema correlating with inflammation and purpura with hemorrhage. Such lesions, when due to immune complex  \ndeposition, usually develop first in dependent areas, which in a bedridden patient may be the back and buttocks.",

Blisters ap -\npear mechanically induced and may lead to secondary milia formation (Fig. 16-7). Immunoglobulin and complement are deposited in a dense, linear pattern along the BMZ, as seen on direct immunofluorescence microscopy, and cir -\nculating IgG anti-BMZ antibody is present in about 50% of patients. Serologic studies demonstrate that this anti-BMZ antibody reacts with a 290-kDa antigen that is type VII collagen, the same antigen as for bullous SLE.\nPathogenesis\nHistopathologically, EBA is characterized by a subepi -\ndermal blister with or without a neutrophilic inflam-matory infiltrate. There is dense deposition of IgG and  \nfrequently complement components along the basement membrane. The majority of cases have a circulating IgG antibody that reacts on indirect immunofluorescence with the dermal side of salt-split skin (skin that has been separated in the lower lamina lucida by incubation with \n1 M sodium chloride). This is in contrast to BP sera, \nwhich react with the epidermal side or both epidermal and dermal sides of such preparations. Blister formation has been reported to occur either below the lamina lucida or below the lamina densa. On immunoelectron micros-copy the immune deposits of EBA are localized to the anchoring fibrils of the sublamina densa region. Lapiere and colleagues have identified the BMZ protein that is antigenic in the sublamina densa region as the noncollag -\nenous (NC-1) domain of type VII collagen. Specifically, antibodies to the fibronectin-like repeats within collagen VII seem to be preferentially formed and probably inter -\nfere with collagen VII\u2013laminin 332 interaction. Passive transfer experiments of IgG anticollagen VII autoanti -\nbody have produced an EBA-like clinical picture in mice.\nPreparations of EBA patients\u2019 anti-BMZ antibodies \nshow both complement-activating and noncomplement-  \nactivating subclasses. However, the presence of com -\nplement-fixing antibodies does not correlate with the inflammatory or noninflammatory clinical subtypes. Ad -\nditionally, when the complement-fixing ability of EBA patients\u2019 serum is measured, it is absent to weak; there -\nfore, it is unlikely that complement plays a major role in blister formation. Nevertheless, an organ culture system utilizing EBA antibody, tissue injury, and BMZ separa-tion can be produced. Eventually, antibody deposition and the inflammatory process may produce sufficient damage to the anchoring fibrils such that minor trauma will produce a loss of dermoepidermal adhesion in the absence of the inflammatory process.\nClassification\nEBA is a sharply defined entity on the basis of its immu -\nnopathologic findings. However, there is a spectrum of clinical and histopathologic manifestations of EBA. Blis -\nters may arise on an inflammatory or a noninflammatory base. Milia may or may not be present. The inflammatory variant is frequently associated with nail dystrophy.\nEBA has been reported to be associated with a variety \nof disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple my-eloma, chronic thyroiditis, diabetes mellitus, lymphoma, amyloidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and cryoglobu -\nlinemia. Many of these may be chance occurrences. The strongest associations appear to be with diabetes mellitus and Crohn\u2019s disease. The mechanism for these associa -\ntions is unclear.\nThe distinction between EBA and bullous lupus ery -\nthematosus is complex. Cases with the clinical criteria for SLE and immunopathologic findings of EBA may well represent a subset of lupus patients in whom the immune dysregulation of lupus results in the production of anti-bodies to type VII collagen.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThe differential diagnosis of subepidermal blistering disease is described under BP.

Lesional skin and \n usually serum demonstrate the presence of an IgG class \nautoantibody directed against desmoglein antigens pres-ent in normal squamous epithelium. The exact mecha -\nnism for this loss of self-tolerance is unknown, but CD4+ T cells recognize distinct epitopes of the extracellular portions of desmoglein 1 and 3, and preferentially pro -\nduce T-helper type 2 (Th2) cytokines. Autoantibody pro -\nduction in pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus is polyclonal, and most antibodies in active disease are of the IgG\n4 subclass. Patients in remission who have persis-\ntent pemphigus antibodies in their serum have mainly the IgG\n1 subtype.\nSeveral lines of evidence support the critical role of \nantibodies to desmogleins in the clinical acantholytic process. First, the antibody is consistently present in le -\nsional skin and the patient\u2019s serum. The serum autoan -\ntibody titers correlate with disease activity and there is a therapeutic response to plasmapheresis. Passive transfer of pemphigus from mothers to neonates occurs.

From a clinical point of view, different types of panniculitis with diverse etiologies can closely resemble one another clinically. There is usually deep induration or inflammation of the skin, accompanied by erythema, warmth, pain, and occasionally ulceration or drainage. Sometimes, panniculitis may represent the dermatologic manifestation of a systemic disease, with erythema nodo -\nsum (EN) being a classic example. Moreover, histopatho -\nlogic differences among the various forms of panniculitis may be very subtle, as the subcutaneous fat responds in a limited number of ways to different stimuli. Therefore, when performing a biopsy in a patient with panniculitis, it is crucial to include an entire fat lobule and its sur -\nrounding connective tissue septa. Excisional biopsies are preferable to punch biopsies. Furthermore, panniculitis, like other inflammatory diseases of the skin, constitutes a dynamic process in which both the composition and the distribution of the inflammatory infiltrate may change within the course of a few days, making the achievement of the correct diagnosis challenging. Finally, manage -\nment of patients with panniculitis may also be difficult, particularly given that treatment of both the specific panniculitis and the underlying illness is often necessary.\nTable 12-1 provides a pattern-based histologic clas -\nsification of the multiple forms of panniculitis. The cat -\negories have been determined based on histopathologic features, as septal versus lobular panniculitis, according to \nthe location in which the inflammatory infiltrate is more abundant. Although there is no purely septal or purely lobular panniculitis, certain forms of panniculitis can be characterized as having predominantly septal or lobular involvement, and this finding can provide a useful clue to diagnosis when combined with other histopathologic fea-tures, such as the presence or absence of vasculitis and the nature of the cells present in the inflammatory infiltrate. Not all of the disease entities in Table 12-1 are presented in detail in this chapter, and the reader is referred to oth-er chapters of this publication or to the suggested reading material for a comprehensive review of this subject.\nPREDOMINANTLY SEPTAL \nPANNICULITIS\nErythema Nodosum\nErythema nodosum (EN) is the best known of the various \nforms of panniculitis, as well as the most common. It can occur at any age, in both sexes, and in all racial groups, al-though it is more common among women during the sec -\nond through fourth decades of life. It is widely regarded as a delayed hypersensitivity response to a variety of an -\ntigenic stimuli, including bacteria, viruses, and chemical agents, although the mechanisms of its development are complex. The relative ranking of underlying causes may vary according to geographic location, and a summarized list of the most common etiologies is outlined in Table \n12-2. However, more than one-third of cases of EN have no known disease association, even when followed over a long period of time. Moreover, although the exact patho-genesis of EN remains unknown, some evidence supports CHAPTER 12\nPanniculitis\nAna M.

In solid organ transplant \nrecipients, the prevalence of KS is 50 times that of the \ngeneral population in endemic areas, and increases to \n400 to 500 times in nonendemic areas. Regression of \nthe mucocutaneous lesions of KS has been observed in \ntransplant patients following a reduction in the level of  \nimmunosuppression or a switch from a systemic calcineu -\nrin inhibitor to mTOR inhibitor therapies such as sirolimus \n(rapamycin).\nHuman Papillomavirus\nVerrucae vulgaris (viral warts) are very common in pa -\ntients who have received solid organ transplants and  reflect their requirement for lifelong immunosuppres -\nsion. The prevalence of warts increases with the duration \nof graft survival, such that the majority of renal transplant \nrecipients with graft durations of more than 5 years have \nverrucae. There are over 90 different types of human pap -\nillomavirus (HPV), and specific types or groupings are as -\nsociated with particular clinical forms of the disease. For \nexample, HPV types 1, 2, and 4 are associated with banal \nwarts, often on the hands and feet ( Fig. 39-4 ); HPV types \n3 and 10 are associated with flat warts (verruca plana); and \nHPV types 6 and 11 (nononcogenic) as well as 16 and 18 \n(oncogenic) are associated with condylomata acuminata \n(venereal warts) ( Fig. 39-5 ).\nNot only can transplant patients have all of the \nHPV types just mentioned, but they have been found \nto harbor unusual types that were once thought to be \nuniquely associated with a rare disease known as epi -\ndermodysplasia verruciformis (e.g., HPV 5, 8, 19 to 25). \nIn addition, the warts are frequently extensive and even \nmore difficult to treat than in the general population. \nThe oncogenic potential of some of these HPV types \ncombined with the chronic immunosuppression cre -\nates a difficult situation in a number of patients.

In pregnant women, topical \nclotrimazole may be used instead.LEISHMANIASIS\nClinical Manifestations\nThe rural type of Old World leishmaniasis is character -\nized by moist chronic ulcers that heal within 6 months. \nRodent reservoirs carry the organism, which is trans -\nmitted via a sand fly vector. Dry lesions and recurrent \nlesions (leishmaniasis recidivans) are associated with \nthe urban type of disease, caused by Leishmania tropi -\nca. New World disease may consist of only cutaneous \nlesions, especially with the mexicana  variety. The pri -\nmary lesion begins as a papule that becomes crusted, \nverrucous, or ulcerated, with an infiltrated red border  \n(Figs 34-1 and 34-2 ). Subcutaneous peripheral nodules \nrepresent a lymphangitic pattern of spread and lymph -\nadenopathy may be present. On the Yucatan Peninsula \nand in Guatemala, the workers who harvest chicle for \nchewing gum develop chiclero ulcers on the ear. The \netiologic agent is Leishmania mexicana  and the sand fly \nvector Lutzomyia flaviscutellata  (Fig. 34-3 ). Uta occurs \nin the Peruvian highlands. As with the chiclero ulcer, \nlesions are found on exposed sites and mucosal lesions \ndo not occur.\nDisseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis occurs with \nboth New and Old World diseases, but the most de -\nstructive manifestations occur with mucocutaneous New \nWorld disease. Diffuse anergic leishmaniasis may resem -\nble lepromatous leprosy or Lobo\u2019s disease.\nOld World L. tropica , Leishmania major , Leishmania \naethiopica , and Leishmania infantum  cause cutaneous \nleishmaniasis. The latter also produced the Mediter -\nranean form of visceral leishmaniasis. New World L. \nmexicana  does not induce mucosal disease. Leishmania \nbraziliensis guyanensis , Leishmania braziliensis brazil -\niensis , and Leishmania braziliensis panamensis  produce \n cutaneous lesions and the latter two are also associ -\nated with mucocutaneous disease. Leishmania donovani  \nspp. donovani , infantum , and chagasi  cause visceral \n leishmaniasis.\nCutaneous leishmaniasis is endemic in Southwest \nAsia, the Mediterranean and Latin America. In the \nUnited States, cutaneous leishmaniasis is most com -\nmon in South Texas, but rare reports of cutaneous dis -\nease have occurred as far north as Pennsylvania and the \nMidwest.\nDogs and rodents are the natural reservoir hosts. The \nOld World vector is the Phlebotomus  sand fly, whereas \nPhlebotomus perniciosus  and Lutzomyia  sand flies are the \nvectors for New World leishmaniasis.

Finally, \nany wound that is not healing after several weeks (8 to 12 weeks) of appropriate treatment should raise the con -\nsideration of an atypical cause, even if the distribution \nand clinical appearance are classic for a common chronic \nwound.\nSome of the most commonly encountered etiologies \nfor an atypical wound include inflammatory causes, infec -\ntions, vasculopathy, metabolic and genetic factors, malig -\nnancies, and external causes ( Fig. 46-13 ).\nTable 46-6  describes the most common atypical leg \nulcers, a brief clinical description, management, and as -\nsociated conditions.\nDIAGNOSTIC TESTS\nLaboratory Tests\nLaboratory investigations are not necessary for all pa -\ntients with leg ulcerations. However, for those with \nnonhealing ulcers, a routine blood cell count and mea -\nsurement of the blood glucose level help exclude clini -\ncally significant hematologic disorders, such as anemia, \nsickle cell disease ( Fig. 46-13 ), or diabetes mellitus. \nA high erythrocyte sedimentation rate may indicate \n osteomyelitis or a connective tissue disorder. Low  \nserum albumin or transferrin levels may suggest nutri -\ntional deficiencies. A high creatinine level may suggest \ncalciphylaxis ( Fig. 46-14 ).

Importantly, measurement of \nplasma antithrombin, protein C, protein S, or procoagu -\nlant levels may be falsely low or high within 6 months of \na thrombotic event, so they should be investigated with \ncaution in the acute setting.

Pemphigus foliaceus accounts for 70% of the penicillamine-induced cases, and pemphigus vulgaris composes the remainder. The development of pemphigus may occur with a wide range of dosages and is often a late complication of therapy.

Pemphigus vulgaris, pemphigus foliaceus, and pemphigus erythematosus have all been noted associations. There is little, if any, concordance between the clinical activities of the coexistent disorders.

Also, when considered alone, the individual fea \u00ad\ntures of myositis are not diagnostic of dermatomyositis \nor polymyositis; rather, the diagnosis is one of exclusion.\nClinically, the myopathy affects mainly the proximal \nmuscle groups of the shoulder and pelvic girdle. In severe, \nprogressive disease all muscles may become involved. \nThe disease is usually symmetric. The initial complaints \ninclude weakness, fatigue, an inability to climb stairs, an \ninability to raise the arms for actions such as hair groom \u00ad\ning or shaving, an inability to rise from a squatting or \nsitting position, or a combination of these features. The \nprogression of disease is variable, but usually occurs over \na period of weeks to months. Muscle aching is a common \nsubjective complaint, but frank tenderness on palpation is \nvariable.

Sarcoidosis almost always involves the lungs; \nthe skin, eyes, and lymph nodes are frequently involved; \nhowever, the disease can involve any organ system in the \nbody. While there are suggestive laboratory and radio -\ngraphic findings supportive of a diagnosis, there exists no \ngold-standard confirmatory diagnostic test. The disease \nis characterized by the presence of granulomatous inflam -\nmation in more than one organ. When this histopatho -\nlogic change is present in tissue samples from multiple \norgan systems, and when appropriate tests exclude other \ncauses of sarcoidal granulomas, the diagnosis of sarcoid -\nosis can be confirmed.\nThe course of sarcoidosis is highly variable. It ranges \nfrom an acute self-healing process, to a chronic disease \nthat primarily affects the skin, to a debilitating systemic \ndisease that can result in blindness, progressive respira -\ntory insufficiency, and sometimes death. Although asso -\nciated with significant morbidity, sarcoidosis is rarely a primary cause of death, with fewer than 5% of patients \ndying of their disease, generally due to severe lung, neu -\nrologic, or cardiac involvement.\nCAUSE AND PATHOGENESIS\nThe cause of sarcoidosis is unknown. The current under -\nstanding entails a genetically susceptible host, who is then \nexposed to an environmental trigger, which sets off the \nhost immune response leading to granuloma formation \nand the clinical disease phenotype. Over the years many \ncauses have been postulated, including viruses (hepatitis \nC, HIV, HHV-8), bacteria ( Mycobacterium , Propionibac -\nterium , Borrelia , Rickettsia , cell-wall-deficient bacteria), \nfungi (cryptococcus), an autoantigen or misfolded pro -\ntein (amyloid A), and foreign materials (pine pollen, be -\nryllium, talc, silica). Coexistent \u201cautoimmune\u201d diseases, \nsuch as autoimmune thyroiditis, alopecia areata, and \nvitiligo, have been reported with varying frequencies in \nsmall studies, and patients with various collagen\u2013vascular \ndiseases (scleroderma, lupus, or dermatomyositis) may be \nmore prone to develop sarcoidosis.\nThere is no single gene that explains sarcoidosis; rath -\ner, the disease is due to a complex interaction between \nthe host immune system and environmental triggers, \nwith multiple genes conferring potential risk. A genetic \ncomponent of sarcoidosis is recognized due to a markedly \nincreased rate of disease in monozygotic twins compared \nto dizygotic twins, with a strong relative risk of 4.7 for \ndisease in family members of affected patients. Multiple \nHLA alleles may play a role in conferring a predilection \nfor developing the disease, and the genes involved may \nvary by ethnic group. HLA-DRB1*01 and DRB1*04 may \nbe protective, while DRB1*03, DRB1*11, DRB1*12, \nDRB1*14, and DRB1*15 may confer an increased risk. \nOne subtype of sarcoidosis, L\u00f6fgren\u2019s syndrome, charac -\nterized by hilar adenopathy, fever, arthritis, and erythema \nnodosum, which tends to be acute and self-resolving, may  \nbe associated with HLA-B8/DR3. African-American  \npatients, an ethnic group with some of the highest overall \nincidence of sarcoidosis and a tendency toward chronic \ndisease, may be more impacted by the HLA-DQB1  \nalleles. Beyond the HLA alleles, specific genes may con -\nfer disease susceptibility, including polymorphisms in \nthe TNF  gene and the IL23R  gene; polymorphisms in \nthe gene encoding angiotensin-converting enzyme have \nalso been identified in patients with sarcoidosis.

Although etanercept \nhas a lower effectiveness compared to the other biolog -\nics, it should be considered a first-line biologic due to its \nlong safety record and lower level of immunosuppres -\nsion compared to the other biologics. Although it has \na comparable effectiveness to adalimumab in psoriasis, \nustekinumab may be considered a second-line biologic \ndue to a lower effectiveness and slower onset of action \nin psoriatic arthritis. However, it may be a better option \nthan a TNF inhibitor if the patient has latent hepatitis B, \nis at higher risk for serious infections, and has a first-de -\ngree relative with multiple sclerosis. Secukinumab should \nbe considered a second-line therapy since there are no \nlong-term safety data that exist yet. It has particular util -\nity in patients who have failed TNF inhibitors. Although \nit has the fastest onset and is the most effective initially, \ninfliximab should be considered a third-line biologic due \nto the nature of its intravenous administration and typical \nloss of efficacy within 1 to 2 years.\nThere is some literature that suggests that treating \npatients with systemic therapy (biologic therapy in par -\nticular) may improve their risk for cardiovascular dis -\nease. Etanercept and adalimumab therapy reduce C-\nreactive protein (CRP) levels in patients with psoriasis, \nwhich correlates with improvement in psoriasis. Among \npatients with psoriasis, the adjusted risk of diabetes was \nlower for individuals starting a TNF inhibitor compared \nwith initiation of other nonbiologic disease-modifying \nantirheumatic drugs such as methotrexate. Another \nstudy showed that use of TNF inhibitors for psoriasis \nwas associated with a significant reduction in myocardial \ninfarction risk and incident rate compared with treat -\nment with topical agents, and that use of TNF inhibi -\ntors for psoriasis was associated with a nonstatistically \nsignificant lower myocardial infarction incident rate \ncompared with treatment with oral agents or photo -\ntherapy. A Danish nationwide cohort showed that TNF \ninhibitors were associated with reduced event rates of \ncardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke \nwhen compared to cyclosporine, retinoids, and other \ntherapies.\nCurrently under way is a National Institutes of Health-\nfunded clinical trial to prospectively study the effect of \ntherapy on biomarkers and on [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose \npositron emission tomography-computed tomography \n(FDG-PET/CT). Patients are enrolled into one of three \ngroups: adalimumab, UVB phototherapy, and placebo. \nEvery 4 weeks for 52 weeks, biomarkers such as CRP and \nlipids will be checked. An FDG-PET/CT scan will be per -\nformed at weeks 0, 12, and 52. The theory is that adalim -\numab will improve biomarkers and reduce vascular inflam -\nmation as measured by the FDG-PET/CT scan. It is also \nbelieved that UVB phototherapy will not improve bio -\nmarkers and not reduce vascular inflammation. This study \ncould show that aggressive systemic therapy may alter the \nnatural history of the cardiovascular disease in psoriasis.\nOn the horizon, there are therapies in the pipeline \ntargeting IL-17, IL-23, and Janus kinase for both psoria -\nsis and psoriatic arthritis.

The \ncutaneous lesions often represent septic emboli, and their \nclinical appearances are similar to emboli due to Gram-\nnegative rods or other fungi such as Aspergillus  (Fig. 39-11 ).  \nIn addition, cutaneous extension of underlying fungal si -\nnus infections can present initially as unilateral facial ede -\nma.

From the dermatologic perspective, \ncytotoxic chemotherapies have long generated much  \ninterest because of the potential to cause alopecia, their hallmark adverse event (AE). The introduction of vari -\nous targeted therapies and immunotherapies in recent years, however, has led to the recognition of a broad spectrum of dermatologic AEs (Table 18-2\n).  Besides \nthe physical and emotional impact, impairments in pa-tients\u2019 quality of life, and financial burden, these AEs may also disrupt cancer treatments. Therefore, their timely recognition and prompt management are cru -\ncial for optimal clinical outcomes.\nIn this chapter, we provide an overview of the der -\nmatologic AEs associated with major classes of cancer therapies, as well as the management options for com -\nmon entities. To indicate severity, we have utilized the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  \n(CTCAE), which is a descriptive tool with unified stan -\ndards for physicians to communicate AEs using common language. The current version, CTCAE v4.0, was issued by the National Cancer Institute in May 2009, and reflects updates on the new AEs seen with targeted therapies, and grading to guide management (\nChen et  al., 2012 ).\nCytotoxic Chemotherapeutic Agents\nAlkylating Agents\nThe alkylating agents cause arrest of cell proliferation by \nforming covalent bonds within DNA bases. The main dermatologic AEs include hyperpigmentation, mucositis, alopecia, hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs), and xerosis associated with pruritus.\nNitrogen Mustards\nMechlorethamine is used intravenously to treat Hodg -\nkin\u2019s disease (MOPP regimen\u2014  mechlorethamine (mus -\ntargen) [M], vincristine [O], procarbazine [P], and pred-nisone [P]), and as part of topical formulations to treat cutaneous malignancies (early-stage mycosis fungoides, CHAPTER 18\nDermatologic  aDverse  events  \nof cancer  therapy\nZhe Hou  \u2022  V iswanath Reddy Belum  \u2022  Mario E.

Treatment with inhibitors of \nangiogenesis often leads to HFS, exanthems, \nhair disorders (alopecia, dyspigmentation, \nand textural changes), xerosis, mucositis, \nand in the case of bevacizumab/aflibercept, \nimpairment of wound healing. The immune \ncheckpoint inhibitors often result in pruritus and \nmaculopapular cutaneous eruptions, although \ntheir AE profile, as with other newly developed \ndrugs, is emerging and pending further \ncharacterization.\n \u2022  Timely recognition, prompt management of \ndermatologic AEs related to cancer treatment, \nand appropriate counseling are crucial for optimal \nclinical outcomes, and require a multidisciplinary \napproach involving oncologists, dermatologists, \nand nurses.\nhttp://e-surg.com",

The lesions are usually sharply demarcated and \ncan be round, thereby giving rise to the term discoid (or \ndisc-like). The presence of scarring and/or atrophy is the \ncharacteristic that separates these lesions from those of \nSCLE. The differential diagnosis most often includes \npapulosquamous diseases such as psoriasis, lichen planus, \nsecondary syphilis, superficial fungal infection, and sar -\ncoidosis. A histopathologic examination is usually helpful \nin confirming the diagnosis, and only rarely is immuno -\nfluorescence microscopy necessary.\nPatients with localized DLE have lesions located sole -\nly on the head, neck, or both. These appear to represent \nthe majority of cases of DLE. These patients differ from \nthose with widespread discoid lesions of LE in a number of ways. They have fewer manifestations that suggest \nsystemic disease, and they less frequently demonstrate a \npositive antinuclear antibody (ANA) or leukopenia. It ap -\npears that patients with DLE who progress to develop \nSLE are generally not in the subset with localized discoid \nlesions of LE. Those patients with disease localized to \nthe head and neck will frequently (roughly 50%) have a \n remission, whereas the disease rarely becomes clinically \ninactive (less than 10%) in those with widespread involve -\nment. Lastly, it also appears that those with widespread \ndisease respond less well to antimalarial treatment. Thus, \nit seems that it is prognostically worthwhile to separate \npatients with localized DLE and those with generalized \nDLE into different subsets.\nHypertrophic Lupus Erythematosus\nHypertrophic or verrucous DLE (HLE) is a unique sub -\nset in which the thick, adherent scale is replaced by mas -\nsive hyperkeratosis, and the resulting lesions resemble \nverruca or squamous cell carcinomas ( Fig. 1-2 ). These \nlesions usually occur in the setting of other, more typical \nDLE lesions. Patients with HLE tend to have chronic \ndisease, to have little in the way of systemic symptoms or \nabnormal laboratory findings, and to be extremely dif -\nficult to treat with conventional therapy. They may re -\nspond to oral retinoids.\nPalmar/Plantar Discoid Lupus \nErythematosus\nThe lesions of DLE can occur on the palms and/or soles \n(Fig. 1-3 ). The frequency of this subset is low, and there \nis no specific clinical or serologic correlation. Patients \nwith DLE of the palms or soles can have chronic cutane -\nous disease, or the lesions can be present in patients with \nSLE. Palmar and/or plantar lesions are often difficult to \ntreat.\nOral Discoid Lupus Erythematosus\nOral DLE lesions are histopathologically and clinically \nsimilar to cutaneous discoid lesions of LE ( Fig. 1-4 ). Oral \nDLE lesions are distinct from the oral and nasal ulcer -\nations that occur in SLE, which are associated with active \nsystemic disease and are histopathologically nonspecific. \nLesions that look like those of discoid lesions of LE in the \noral mucosa have associations similar to those seen with \nlocalized or widespread discoid lesions of LE.\nTumid Lupus Erythematosus\nTumid lupus erythematosus (lupus tumidus) is charac -\nterized by erythematous to violaceous papules, plaques \n(Fig. 1-5 ), or nodules, that usually occur on sun-exposed \nsurfaces. The lesions classically have no epidermal \nchanges and tend to heal with no residual scarring or \natrophy. Patients with tumid LE are photosensitive. Se -\nrologic abnormalities are distinctly uncommon in these \npatients, and patients with tumid LE rarely meet criteria \nfor SLE.",

Spider angioma \npresents as a central erythematous papule (dilated arte -\nriole) with radiating telangiectactic branches, often sur -\nrounded by a 3- to 4-mm anemic halo. Spider angiomas \nof pregnancy develop most commonly in areas drained \nby the superior vena cava (i.e., head, neck, upper chest, \nupper extremities).

The \npresence of edema in a pregnant woman should alert the physician to the possibility of pregnancy-induced \nhypertension, which carries a significant risk to mother \nand fetus, and appropriate further evaluation should be \nundertaken.\nVaricosities\nCompression of the pelvic and femoral vessels by the \ngravid uterus results in the formation of lower-extremity  \n(saphenous), vulvar, and hemorrhoidal varicosities. Genet -\nic predisposition poses additional risk. Lower-extremity \nvaricosities occur in 40% of pregnant women.

Inflammation is mixed, and can include neutrophils, lym -\nphocytes, macrophages, and multinucleated giant cells.

There is considerable evidence that the enzymes lipase, amylase, and trypsin are involved in producing the lesions of PP, with lipase having the clearest relationship with the panniculitis. However, el -\nevated enzyme levels are not the complete explanation for the changes of PP, and immunologic factors may also play a role. Clinically, subcutaneous, erythematous, and often painful nodules develop, frequently on the ex -\ntremities (Fig. 12-3), but also on the abdomen, chest, arms, and scalp, and even in the visceral fat. The lesions may become fluctuant and ulcerate, discharging an oily material, and usually involute within a period of weeks, leaving hyperpigmented scars.

The amount of hair growth that \nis considered abnormal depends on cultural factors and \nrace. Affected patients grow hair in places in which ter -\nminal hair is not typically found, such as the face, chest, \nabdomen, and back in a woman ( Fig. 43-14 ). Hirsut -\nism, acne, and androgenetic alopecia are the cutaneous \nmanifestations of hyperandrogenic states. Alternatively, \npatients may have normal androgen levels but increased \nsensitivity to circulating androgens. Hirsutism may be ge -\nnetic or secondary to adrenal, ovarian, or mixed adrenal \nand ovarian etiologies ( Table 43-8 ). Polycystic ovarian \nsyndrome is the most common cause of abnormal andro -\ngen production, and in addition to the cutaneous signs of \nhyperandrogenism, may also be characterized by irregu -\nlar menstrual periods, insulin resistance, hypertension, \nand dyslipidemia. Hirsutism may also be associated with \nacromegaly and thyroid dysfunction. Anabolic steroids, \nandrogenic progestins, and glucocorticoids are iatrogenic \ncauses of hirsutism.\nDiagnosis and Treatment\nBefore embarking on a litany of expensive laboratory \nstudies, hirsute patients can be roughly screened for hor -\nmonal abnormalities with a thorough history. One should \ninquire about cystic acne, regular menses, infertility, and \ngalactorrhea. If these are absent and there is a family his -\ntory of hirsute women, the patient is unlikely to have any \nunderlying hormonal imbalance. If indicated, laboratory \nstudies can be used to rule out serious underlying disor -\nders in the hirsute patient.\nThe medical treatment of hirsutism consists of sup -\npressing ovarian or adrenal androgen secretion, or of \nblocking androgen action in the skin. Oral contracep -\ntives and antiandrogens such as spironolactone, cyprot -\nerone acetate, and flutamide have been used therapeuti -\ncally. Glucocorticoids, gonadotropin-releasing hormone \nagonists such as leuprolide, and insulin-sensitizing agents \nhave also been used. Although the endocrinologic evalu -\nation and treatment of hirsutism are beyond the scope of \nthis chapter, excellent references are available. Cosmetic \nimprovement of hirsutism may be achieved via the previ -\nously mentioned modalities.SUGGESTED READING\nBlume U , Ferracin J , et al.

With the topical formulation, irritant or allergic contact dermatitis is the most common acute complication. An increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) with both systemic and topical use of mechlorethamine has also been reported.\nManagement of the cutaneous eruption includes topi -\ncal corticosteroids (mild/moderate cases); oral corticoste-roids and dose reductions may improve tolerability in a majority of patients with severe reactions. Topical reti -\nnoids, hydroquinones, and corticosteroids are effective in treating skin hyperpigmentation.\nCyclophosphamide is widely used in the treatment \nof various cancers, autoimmune diseases, and also dur -\ning bone marrow transplantation (preparative stage). The most common dermatologic AE is alopecia (40% \nto 60%), which develops 3 to 6  weeks after the start of  \ntherapy.

Immunocompromised hosts are also at risk \nfor the development of infections with the opportunistic \nfungus Aspergillus , in particular A. flavus  and A.  fumigatus . \nInvasive infections with Aspergillus  spp., a ubiquitous di -\nmorphic fungus, are the second most frequent oppor -\ntunistic infections in transplant recipients, particularly \nin the early period post transplantation, and in some \nsettings have overtaken Candida  spp. as the most com -\nmon opportunistic fungal infection if the patient is not \non an Aspergillus -active azole as prophylaxis. The major \nrisk factors remain systemic corticosteroid therapy and \nprolonged neutropenia. As is the case with disseminated \ncandidiasis, shorter engraftment times after peripheral \nblood stem cell transplants (compared to bone marrow \ntransplants) have reduced the number of early Aspergil -\nlus infections. Later infections in hematopoietic stem \ncell transplant patients are usually associated with the \nuse of corticosteroid therapy for GVHD. Voriconazole \nis frequently used as prophylaxis in high-risk patients; \nhowever, due to the recently reported risk of skin can -\ncer associated with the use of voriconazole, alternative \nagents, e.g., posaconazole, are recommended in certain \ntransplant recipients who are particularly susceptible to \nskin cancer (see below).\nPrimary cutaneous infections develop at sites of trau -\nma, including those from intravenous catheter use. Both \nocclusive adhesive tape and arm boards have been associ -\nated with primary Aspergillus  infections, but fortunately \ntheir use has decreased as the use of indwelling central \nvenous catheters has increased. Secondary cutaneous  \nlesions of Aspergillus  represent septic emboli due to sys -\ntemic infection. The primary source is often pulmonary, \nand the cutaneous lesions vary from erythematous pap -\nules to ecthyma gangrenosum-like lesions ( Fig. 39-11 A).  \nBiopsy specimens demonstrate septate, acute-branching \nfungi in the dermis and invading the walls of blood vessels \n(Fig. 39-11 B).\nIf the primary lesions of aspergillosis are fairly well \ncircumscribed, treatment consists of surgical excision and \noral antifungal agents. Voriconazole is widely prescribed \nfor use as a prophylactic agent and treatment of invasive \nfungal infections in transplant recipients. Voriconazole \nhas now been established as an independent risk factor \nfor the development of cutaneous malignancy in trans -\nplant recipients. Several series have reported skin cancer, \nparticularly cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, among \nhematopoietic stem cell and solid organ transplant  \npatients receiving long-term voriconazole (12 months). \nThough the mechanism of voriconazole-induced skin \ncancer is unknown, it may induce phototoxicity due to \nits primary metabolite, voriconazole N-oxide. The FDA \nhas altered its labeling to state that voriconazole should \nbe used carefully, for durations of less than 6 to 9 months, \nparticularly among patients with risk factors for skin \ncancer. In patients requiring prolonged voriconazole, \n diligent skin cancer screening examinations, sun protec -\ntion, and liberal use of UV protectants is advisable.Currently, however, systemic disease is treated with \nvoriconazole, which has been shown to be more effec -\ntive than amphotericin for documented Aspergillus  infec -\ntions.

The key cytokines include Th1 \ncytokines such as IL-2, IL-12, IL-18, and IFN- \u03b3, granu -\nlocyte\u2013monocyte colony stimulating factor, and TNF- \u03b1 \nproduction by macrophages. The inflammatory pattern  \nmay vary by ethnicity, inciting antigenic trigger, or  \npotentially disease phenotype, with different patterns of \ninflammation in patients with acute and self-resolving \nsarcoidosis compared to patients with chronic inflamma -\ntory or fibrotic disease. The end result is that sarcoidosis \nis a multifactorial combination of possible immunologic \n(T-cell receptor), genetic (HLA), infectious, or environ -\nmental factors (antigen[s]), and to date no single compo -\nnent can explain all cases of sarcoidosis.\nBecause of the lack of a consistent identifiable \nantigen(s), the polymorphic nature of the disease, and the \nlack of an animal model, a definitive pathogenesis is spec -\nulative at present and active research is ongoing. Sarcoid -\nosis is believed to be a disorder of the lymphoreticular \nsystem characterized by the depression of cell-mediated \nimmunity (delayed-type hypersensitivity), an imbalance \nof CD4/CD8 cells (helper-to-suppressor T-cell ratio), a \nhyperreactivity of B cells, and increased production of cir -\nculating immune complexes. It is believed that the inter -\naction between T cells and antigens, antigen-presenting \ncells and cytokines in the correct genetic milieu affects  \nT-cell function, which results in a secondary increase in \nB-cell activity. Prolonged antigenic stimulation may affect \nmacrophages. As sarcoidal granulomas develop, enzyme \nsecretion (in particular, secretion of angiotensin-  \nconverting enzyme\u2014ACE) may occur. Elevation of ACE is  \nprobably the result of granuloma formation, and in some \npatients may reflect overall granuloma burden, although \nthe ACE level overall lacks sensitivity, specificity, or reli -\nability and cannot readily be utilized to either diagnose \nor follow disease activity over time. The precise reasons \nfor the effects of the presumptive causative antigen(s) on \npatients with sarcoidosis are not understood. However, \nthe result appears to be an overall somewhat anergic \nstate, with a reduced reaction to recalled antigens, such \nas purified protein derivative, Candida , mumps, and the \ninability to sensitize an individual with sarcoidosis to an \nantigen such as dinitrochlorobenzene. Elevated levels of \n\u03b3-globulin and nonspecific elevation of antibody titers to \nvarious viruses and fungal elements may also occur.\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\nCutaneous Manifestations\nThe skin is involved in 25% to 30% of patients with sar -\ncoidosis, and the cutaneous manifestations of sarcoid -\nosis are protean. Individual skin lesions are classified as \neither specific or nonspecific, based on the histopath -\nologic examination. Those cutaneous lesions repre -\nsented histopathologically by noncaseating granulomas \nare termed \u201cspecific\u201d cutaneous lesions of sarcoidosis. \nThose lesions that do not show noncaseating granulo -\nmas are termed nonspecific, and are usually applied to \nlesions such as erythema nodosum. The specific cutane -\nous lesions include papules, plaques, nodules, subcuta -\nneous nodules (\u201cDarrier\u2013Roussy\u201d sarcoidosis), scar\u2014 or tattoo\u2014associated papules, and lupus pernio. In addi -\ntion, there are multiple less common presentations of \nspecific cutaneous lesions such as acquired ichthyosis, \nerythroderma, psoriasiform, ulcerative, verrucous, scar -\nring or nonscarring alopecia, photodistributed, and \nangiolupoid sarcoidosis. Interestingly, nail disease has \nbeen reported both as specific and nonspecific.\nThe most common nonspecific manifestation of sar -\ncoidosis is erythema nodosum (EN). These lesions are \nfirm, slightly erythematous to red-brown subcutane -\nous nodules, most commonly occurring symmetrically \non the anterior tibial surfaces. They are often tender to \npalpation. When erythema nodosum is associated with \nsarcoidosis, it is frequently accompanied by uveitis, fe -\nver, arthritis, and asymptomatic bilateral hilar lymph -\nadenopathy.

As in patients with other \nsclerosing disorders overlying a joint, referral for physi -\ncal therapy is imperative.\nRAYNAUD\u2019S PHENOMENON AND \nRELATED DISORDERS\nRaynaud\u2019s phenomenon, presenting as color change of \nthe affected digits, is reflective of paroxysmal vasospasm \noften in response to cool temperatures. While classic \nRaynaud\u2019s is triphasic (progressing from white to blue \nto red), biphasic attacks (white to blue) are consistent \nas well. Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon can be classified as ei -\nther primary (idiopathic, a.k.a. \u201cRaynaud\u2019s disease\u201d) or \nsecondary (related to underlying conditions, including \nSSc).\nCriteria for primary Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon include \nnegative or low-titer ANA, the absence of both clini -\ncal features (e.g., sclerodactyly, calcinosis, ischemic tis -\nsue injury) and history of underlying connective tissue \ndisease, and normal nailfold capillaries. Nailfold capil -\nlaries are readily visible with dermoscopy; abnormali -\nties observed in SSc and related disorders may include \nenlarged or disorganized capillaries, hemorrhages, and \ncapillary drop-out. These changes are a marker for risk \nof progression to SSc or other autoimmune connec -\ntive tissue disease in patients presenting with Raynaud\u2019s \nphenomenon.\nTreatment for Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon includes life -\nstyle modification (staying warm, moderating caffeine, \nand smoking cessation) for all patients. In treating pa -\ntients with SSc, dihydropyridine-type calcium channel \nblockers (e.g., nifedipine) are considered first-line. Con -\nsideration can be given to adding or switching to a phos -\nphodiesterase 5 inhibitor (e.g., sildenafil) if response is \ninadequate. Prostanoids, such as intravenous iloprost, can \nbe employed as a temporizing measure in cases of critical \nischemia, e.g., while awaiting surgical intervention such \nas digital sympathectomy. Fluoxetine 20 to 40 mg/day \nmay be an alternative or adjunctive agent in the setting of \nlow blood pressure. Other agents occasionally employed \ninclude angiotensin receptor blockers, alpha-blockers, \npentoxifylline, and botulinum toxin.\nDigital ulcers and/or pitting scars in patients with \nRaynaud\u2019s phenomenon are indicative of ischemic inju -\nry (Fig. 3-10 ) and herald the presence of an underlying \nconnective tissue disease such as SSc. Digital ulcers in \npatients with SSc are frequently multifactorial with con -\ntributions from ischemia, sclerosis, trauma, poor healing, \ncalcinosis, and/or infection. Workup includes Doppler \nexam for pulses, evaluation for hypercoagulability and \nvasculitis, swab cultures, radiographs, and vascular im -\naging and/or consult, as appropriate. Wound care may \ninclude hydrocolloid and other occlusive dressings. The \ntherapeutic ladder for the prevention and treatment of \ndigital ulcers is otherwise similar to that for Raynaud\u2019s \nphenomenon.MIXED CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE\nPatients with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) \ndemonstrate overlapping features of two or more au -\ntoimmune connective tissue diseases and high titers of \npathogenic autoantibodies against the U1 small nuclear \nribonucleoprotein autoantigen.

While initial reports had suggested \na milder disease course in these patients, more recent \ndata suggest that severe internal organ involvement, in -\ncluding PAH, may be a late manifestation with a nega -\ntive prognostic impact.

Whereas myalgias are classically associated with \nsystemic candidiasis, muscle pain and tenderness due to \nseptic emboli can be seen with other opportunistic in -\nfections (see below).\nAlthough disseminated candidiasis is associated with \npositive blood cultures more often than are other sys -\ntemic fungal infections, blood cultures may be negative. \nHowever, a biopsy specimen from a purpuric lesion is \nusually diagnostic, with yeast forms and pseudohyphae \npresent in the dermis ( Fig. 39-10 C) and vascular spaces. \nA tissue fungal culture should be performed using ster -\nile technique, i.e., the culture should be representative of \norganisms growing in the dermis, not the surface stra -\ntum corneum. Candida  spp. that have been isolated from \npatients with disseminated candidiasis include C. albicans ,  \nC. tropicalis , C. krusei , C. parapsilosis , and C. glabrata .\nTreatment of disseminated candidiasis depends on the \nseverity of the illness as well as the specific isolate and its sensitivities. The use of prophylactic fluconazole has led \nto a greater incidence of non- C. albicans  species, which \nmay be resistant to fluconazole: e.g., C. krusei  is well \nknown to be resistant to fluconazole. Therapeutic op -\ntions include intravenous and oral azoles/triazoles (e.g., \nfluconazole [unless disease developed while on this drug], \nvoriconazole) or echinocandins (e.g., caspofungin, mi -\ncafungin, anidulafungin), which inhibit glycan synthase.",

Alopecia and \nleukonychia are two common dermatologic AEs of vori-nostat; they regress after discontinuation of treatment.\nRomidepsin is approved for refractory CTCL, and is \nassociated with rare dermatologic AEs such as oral can-didiasis, mild drug eruptions, hypersensitivity, anticoag-ulant-induced skin necrosis, vasculitis, serum sickness, angioedema, SJS, and TEN.\nProteasome Inhibitors\nBortezomib inhibits the proteosomal degradation of NF-\u03baB, activates cell signaling to induce apoptosis, and inhib -\nits various pro-proliferative cytokines. It is indicated in the treatment of MM and mantle cell lymphoma. Erythema -\ntous papules, nodules, and plaques, with a varied distribu -\ntion have been reported with bortezomib; ulcerations and morbilliform exanthems may also occur. Low dose predni -\nsone, with or without antihistamines, has been utilized to treat the erythematous eruptions. Bortezomib is also asso -\nciated with non-necrotizing small vessel cutaneous vascu -\nlitis and Sweet\u2019s syndrome. While the former may respond to topical corticosteroids, the latter may be so severe that it may necessitate intravenous methylprednisolone.\nDemethylating Agents\n5-Azacitidine (5-AzaC) and decitabine inhibit DNA \nmethylation, thereby leading to cell proliferation abnor -\nmalities and triggering of apoptosis. They are indicated in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute/chronic leukemia. 5-AzaC is associated with injection site reactions, presenting as erythematous plaques , and \nSweet\u2019s syndrome (Trickett et al., 2012\n). Decitabine-  \nassociated dermatologic AEs are rare, with only one case of NEH having been reported in the literature.\nRetinoids\nBexarotene and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) are \nretinoids used in the treatment of various cancers. For e.g., bexarotene is indicated in CTCL, in both the oral and topi -\ncal formulations. ATRA is used to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) characterized by the presence of t(15;17)  \ntranslocation. Retinoids are commonly associated with der-matitis (xerosis, pruritus, and cheilitis) and skin irritation. ATRA can induce neutrophilic eruptions such as Sweet\u2019s syndrome, or more specifically  scrotal ulcers , which are \noften neutrophilic on biopsy. On the other hand, topical bexarotene has been associated with pain, vesiculobullous lesions, irritant reactions, and \u201csticky skin.\u201d\nArsenicals\nArsenic trioxide (ATO) is used in the treatment of non -\nresponsive or relapsed APL (refractory to ATRA), MM, \nmyelodysplastic syndrome, and some solid tumors. It can induce a mild to moderate nonspecific dermatitis, and has been reported to increase the susceptibility to (localized) herpes zoster infection possibly via immunosuppression.\nTargeted Anticancer Therapies\nMolecularly targeted agents are relatively new additions to the (oncologic) therapeutic armamentarium. These therapies are designed to inhibit specific oncoproteins/enzymes essential in various signaling cascades and cell proliferation. Although remarkably successful in treating cancers, their use has also been associated with a number of dermatologic AEs among others ( Table 18-2; Balagula \net al., 2010 ).\nEpidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Inhibitors\nThe approved EGFR inhibitors (EGFRIs) may be grouped \ninto: (1) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs, e.g., cetuximab, panitumumab) that bind to the extracellular domain of EGFR and result in receptor internalization and subse-quent degradation; and (2) small molecule inhibitors (e.g., erlotinib, afatinib) that target the intracellular tyrosine \nkinase domain by competing with the binding of ad -\nenosine triphosphate. Dual inhibitors against EGFR and ErbB2 (Her2/neu) have also been developed (e.g., lapa-\ntinib).",

Pa -\ntients with a butterfly rash usually have active systemic \ndisease, but there is no specific correlation between the \nmalar rash and the particular organ system involved. \nIn addition patients with ACLE may develop a papu -\nlar eruption on sun-exposed areas, including the dor -\nsal arms and hands, which characteristically spares the \nknuckles.\nSeveral cutaneous abnormalities were previously part \nof the ACR criteria for SLE, but have been found to be \nless specific than photosensitivity. Diffuse hair loss (alo -\npecia) was one of the original criteria. Patients with SLE \ncan develop a diffuse hair thinning, but this is most likely \nrelated to the presence of a severe episode of systemic ill -\nness. This type of hair loss is seen after major surgery, or \ncan follow systemic infections or pregnancy. It is known \nas telogen effluvium because the trauma of the associated \ndisease forces most hairs to cycle into the same phase, and \nthey then all go through the telogen (resting) phase 3 to \n6 months later, at which time the hair loss occurs. This \nhair loss is different than that resulting from the alopecic \nlesions of DLE.\nPhotosensitivity is a major factor in all types of cuta -\nneous LE. It is one of the 11 ACR criteria for the clas -\nsification of SLE. Photosensitivity implies that there is \nan abnormal reaction to sunlight. An abnormal reaction \nto sunlight occurs in all patients with LE; however, in \ngeneral, most of those with DLE are not considered \nto have \u201ctrue\u201d photosensitivity, despite a worsening of \ntheir clinical disease in the spring and summer. Almost \nall patients with SCLE are photosensitive, and about \n60% to 75% of those with SLE demonstrate photosen -\nsitivity. Studies have demonstrated that UVB, UVA, \nor both may exacerbate cutaneous disease in the lupus \npatient. In addition, polymorphous light eruption may \nbe more common in LE patients, and also appears to \nbe more common in their family members.OTHER CUTANEOUS CHANGES \nASSOCIATED WITH LUPUS \nERYTHEMATOSUS\nAny mucosal surface (oral, nasal, or vaginal) may be affect -\ned in LE. Occasionally the lesions may be histologically \nspecific, but nonspecific erosions or ulcerations are seen in \nroughly 5% to 10% of patients with SLE. The presence of \noral ulcers may correlate with active systemic disease.\nRaynaud\u2019s phenomenon was one of the original 14 cri -\nteria for SLE. It occurs in otherwise healthy patients and \nin those with systemic sclerosis, cold-associated disorders, \nor other collagen\u2013vascular diseases. There has been some \nsuggestion that the presence of Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon \nis associated with a more benign SLE course, but this is \ncontroversial.\nPalmar erythema and periungual telangiectases occur \nas nonspecific signs of SLE. Periungual telangiectases are \nan important finding in patients with DLE because they \noccur only in patients who are likely to have or to develop \nSLE. Nailfold capillaroscopy has also demonstrated ab -\nnormalities, but the use of this procedure to differentiate \nLE from other collagen\u2013vascular diseases is controversial.\nSecondary Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome occurs in LE, and \nits incidence varies from 5% in chronic cutaneous LE \nto 10% to 30% in SCLE and SLE. The presence of \nSj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome has been linked to cutaneous vascu -\nlitis and central nervous system disease in patients with \nLE. Cutaneous vasculitis can also complicate LE. It can \nbe manifested as urticaria-like lesions, nailfold infarcts, \nor palpable purpura. The presence of vasculitis in the \npatient with SCLE has been correlated with a positive \nanti-Ro (SS-A) titer, but not with active systemic disease. \nHowever, the presence of vasculitis in patients with SLE \ncorrelates with active disease and a poor prognosis. In \nparticular, active renal disease or central nervous system \ndisease has been reported in patients with vasculitis.",

Three of them are mentioned in the \nWHO classification, namely, pilotropic MF, localized pag -\netoid reticulosis, and granulomatous slack skin. While local -\nized pagetoid reticulosis and granulomatous slack skin show a chronic course and good prognosis (patients with local -\nized pagetoid reticulosis may undergo long-standing com-plete remission), pilotropic MF seems to be characterized by a more aggressive course than the \u201cconventional\u201d vari -\nants of the disease. A thorough discussion of these variants is beyond the scope of this chapter. Granulomatous slack skin may be viewed as a subset of MF, but there is ample evidence that it may be more appropriately viewed as a syn -\ndrome that may result from a variety of hematologic dis -\neases\u2014up to 50% are associated with Hodgkin\u2019s, and other reports include non-Hodgkin\u2019s, MF, acute myelogenous leukemia, and Langerhans histiocytosis. Granulomatous slack skin shares many features with MF but it is not clear that it should always be considered to represent MF.\nPrognosis and selection of proper treatment for MF \ndepends on the stage of the disease (as well as on previous treatments). Most patients will never require aggressive therapy and can be managed with skin-directed options (e.g., psoralen and ultraviolet A, retinoids, etc.). Systemic chemotherapy is usually effective only for short periods, and recurrences are the rule. Large numbers of systemic, partly experimental therapies have been tested in the last decades (indirectly showing that no treatment option is giving a true chance for cure). In recent years several independent stud -\nies showed that patients with advanced stage disease may be treated successfully with allogeneic stem cell transplantation.\nS\u00e9zary Syndrome\nSS is characterized clinically by pruritic erythroderma, \ngeneralized lymphadenopathy, and the presence of cir -\nculating malignant T lymphocytes. It is considered as a disease distinct from MF, and prognosis is much worse (5-year survival of about 20% to 30%). Diagnostic crite -\nria include the presence of the same monoclonal popula -\ntion of T lymphocytes within the peripheral blood and the skin, of at least 1000 circulating S\u00e9zary cells/mm\n3, of \nan expanded CD4+ population in the peripheral blood resulting in a markedly increased CD4:CD8 ratio, of an increased population of CD4+/CD7\u2013 cells or CD4+/CD26\u2013in the peripheral blood, and of the loss of T-cell antigens such as CD2, CD3, and CD5. Although SS is considered a leukemic variant of CTCL, the bone mar -\nrow is usually not affected in early phases.\nPatients present with a variably rapid onset of erythro -\nderma and lymph node enlargement. The erythroderma is characterized by intense pruritus and scaling, and the pruritus may be intractable. Complete staging investiga -\ntions should be performed upon a confirmed diagnosis of SS (Table 20-3 ). Since many non-neoplastic disorders may \npresent with erythroderma (e.g., psoriasis, drug eruptions, etc.), accurate diagnostic investigations are crucial in order to manage patients properly. It is also crucial to remember that in a distinct proportion of patients (up to 50%) a pre -\ncise diagnosis is not possible (\u201cidiopathic\u201d erythroderma, \u201cred man syndrome\u201d). Some of these patients eventually progress to clear-cut SS. At the present state of knowledge, however, patients with \u201cidiopathic\u201d erythroderma should \nnot be treated aggressively (symptomatic treatment of as -\nsociated symptoms such as pruritus, regular controls to \nmonitor the disease). Extracorporeal photopheresis has been successfully used to treat both overt SS and idiopathic erythroderma, but the efficacy tends to be limited in time, and patients with advanced disease usually show progres -\nsion in spite of treatment. As in advanced MF, allogeneic stem cell transplantation may represent a successful option for patients with SS as well.\nPrimary Cutaneous CD30+ \nLymphoproliferative Disorders (pcCD30+LD)\npcCD30+LD include lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) and \ncutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (cALCL). These diseases are considered as two ends of a spectrum without clear-cut boundaries.",

Patients \ntypically improve with early placement on highly ac -\ntive antiretroviral therapy.\nPruritus is a frequent complaint in patients with \nAIDS, and secondary lesions that simply represent \nchronic rubbing, e.g., lichen simplex chronicus and pru -\nrigo nodularis, can be seen admixed with more specific \nprimary lesions. Once scabies, drug eruptions, specific \ndermatoses such as eczematous eruptions, arthropod \nbite reactions, and \u201csystemic\u201d causes of pruritus (e.g., \ncholestasis, renal failure, lymphoma, parasitic infec -\ntions) are excluded, the differential diagnosis includes \nxerosis (see below), folliculitis, eosinophilic folliculitis, \nand the pruritic papular eruption of HIV/AIDS. Eo -\nsinophilic folliculitis is characterized by pruritic edema -\ntous perifollicular papules, primarily on the upper trunk \nand in the head and neck region ( Fig. 35-19 ), and it \nis usually associated with advanced disease. In biopsy \nspecimens, eosinophils are found within hair follicles. \nThe skin-colored papules of the pruritic papular erup -\ntion of HIV/AIDS tend to favor the extremities, but can \nalso involve the trunk; one hypothesis is that the erup -\ntion represents an exaggerated response to arthropod \nbites or other allergens. Both disorders may improve \nfollowing UVB phototherapy, as well as with immune \nreconstitution.\nPatients who are HIV-positive have an increased inci -\ndence of cutaneous drug eruptions, usually morbilliform \nor urticarial, but others include photolichenoid, eryth -\nrodermic, drug hypersensitivity syndrome, pigmentary \nchanges, injection site reaction, retinoid-like reaction, \nor the spectrum of Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome/toxic \nFIGURE 35-16  n Psoriasis of the digits in an HIV-infected patient. \nNote the accompanying nail dystrophy.

Patients with lichen amyloidosis devel -\nop pruritic, hyperkeratotic, skin-colored or hyperpig -\nmented papules, particularly on the anterior lower ex -\ntremities, although other areas may be involved. Those with macular amyloidosis have pruritic, oval, grayish-brown macules that may coalesce to rippled or reticu -\nlar hyperpigmented patches on the lower extremities or back. Patients with both macular and papular lesions are sometimes classified as having biphasic amyloidosis, but macular, biphasic, and lichen amyloidoses probably rep -\nresent a continuum of the same process. These cutaneous amyloidoses are thought to have a keratin protein as the amyloid fibril precursor and are considered an amyloid keratin (AK) protein type of amyloidosis. The biopsy  \nspecimens in these disorders show distinctive changes that aid in distinguishing them from systemic amyloi-dosis. Variants, such as poikilodermatous or vitiliginous amyloidoses, have been reported; these may develop early in life and may be associated with short stature or light sensitivity (e.g., amyloidosis cutis dyschromica). Familial syndromes of lichen amyloidosis have also been reported. Familial primary localized cutaneous amy -\nloidosis is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with chronic pruritus and AK amyloid deposition in the dermis. This syndrome is associated with missense mutations in the oncostatin M-specific receptor \u03b2 gene. \nSeveral reports now exist of a familial syndrome of mul -\ntiple endocrine neoplasia type 2a associated with lichen amyloidosis.\nLocalized amyloid AK deposition may occur around \nor within a number of cutaneous growths, including ac -\ntinic keratoses, basal cell carcinomas, Bowen\u2019s disease (a form of in situ squamous cell carcinoma), and seborrheic keratoses. Patients undergoing psoralen\u2013ultraviolet A light treatment also may have subclinical cutaneous amy-loid deposition, presumably of the AK type.\nAlthough nodular (tumefactive) cutaneous amyloido-\nsis is also considered to be a form of primary cutaneous amyloidosis, it is not the result of AK disease. Amyloid deposition in nodular cutaneous amyloidosis is thought to derive from a light chain precursor produced at the site by surrounding clonally restricted plasma cells. This type of amyloidosis presents as nodules on the face, ex -\ntremities, trunk, or genitalia. These nodules are usually skin colored and frequently have overlying epidermal at -\nrophy or features resembling anetoderma. The mean age \nat diagnosis is 55  years, with a range of 20 to 87  years, \nand there is no gender predilection. Patients with nodular cutaneous amyloidosis require regular follow-up because some may develop systemic amyloidosis. Initial reports suggested a 50% progression rate to systemic amyloido -\nsis, but more recent data suggest that the rate is less than 10%. Local light chain production and conversion to AL amyloid should not result in a detectable serum or urine monoclonal protein; its presence should suggest the need for further work-up and close follow-up.\nA second form of skin-limited nodular amyloidosis \nmay develop at sites of repetitive subcutaneous insulin \nhttp://e-surg.com",

Red lunulae have been reported in patients \nwith lymphogranuloma venereum, and pale gray nails in \npatients with malaria. Loss of the lunula, paronychia, leuk -\nonychia, painful subungual abscesses, lilac line of Milan, \nand pterygium unguium have all been noted in association \nwith leprosy. In addition, paronychia has been reported in \npatients with cutaneous leishmaniasis.\nPatients with AIDS may have yellowing of the nails, \nonychomycosis (which may be superficial), splinter hem -\norrhages, as well as ridging. Zidovudine has been shown \nto cause longitudinal pigmented bands and yellow-brown \ndiscoloration of the nails.\nCentral and Peripheral Nervous Systems\nMost nail findings associated with neurologic disorders are \nnonspecific. In Lesch\u2013Nyhan disease, patients compul -\nsively bite their fingers, which results in destruction of the \ndigital tips and nails (onychotillomania). In central nervous \nsystem disease, there may be splinter hemorrhages and on -\nycholysis. Onychogryphosis is associated with spinal cord \ninjuries, whereas Beau lines are associated with epilepsy. \nLongitudinal striations may be seen in cases of multiple \nsclerosis, syringomyelia, and hemiplegia.\nMore specific nail findings are found in patients with neu -\nrofibromatosis type I and tuberous sclerosis.  Patients with \nneurofibromatosis type I may present with  erythronychia \nsecondary to subungual glomus tumors. Approximately \n50% of patients with tuberous sclerosis present with pathog -\nnomonic periungual fibromas (Koenen tumors), which are \nsmooth, pedunculated, flesh-colored papules that originate \nunder the proximal nail fold and extend above the nail plate.\nPsychiatric Conditions\nOnychotillomania is observed in obsessive\u2013compulsive \ndisorder, and findings may include onycholysis, splinter hemorrhages, and hematomas. If severe, scarring, pterygi -\num, paronychia, and ingrown nails may be present. Striated \nleukonychia can be seen in bipolar disorder, and there is an \nassociation between a family history of schizophrenia and \nvisibility of the subcapillary plexus. Double-edged nails are \nfound in some cases of psychosis, and broad white bands \nof the nails may follow an acute psychotic episode. Finally, \nbrittle nails are seen in patients with anorexia nervosa.\nPulmonary System\nThe yellow nail syndrome is characterized by the tri -\nad of  yellow nails, lymphedema, and respiratory tract \n involvement, which may include asthma, pleural effusion, \ntuberculosis, bronchiectasis, chronic sinusitis, chronic \nbronchitis, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Nails \nare thick and yellow, with an increased transverse curva -\nture, absent cuticles, and slow growth rate ( Fig. 44-10 ). \nYellow nail syndrome is linked to an array of  underlying \ndiseases including malignancies such as melanoma, sar -\ncoma, lymphoma, and renal carcinoma, as well as diabetes \nmellitus, thyroid dysfunction, rheumatoid  arthritis, myo -\ncardial infarction, and nephrotic syndrome. In addition, \nelevated titanium levels have recently been reported in a \nfew patients with yellow nail syndrome.\nClubbing and red lunulae are seen in association with \nemphysema, chronic bronchitis, tuberculosis, pneumo -\nnia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

The nail is often thin and brittle, \nwith longitudinal ridging, splitting easily. Discoloration \noften occurs secondary to an accumulation of debris and \ninfection. There may be onycholysis, koilonychias, and a \nmild reduction in the growth rate. Excessive cold expo -\nsure may produce Beau lines as a result of a temporary \ninterruption of nail growth. Pterygium formation may \ncomplicate vasomotor ischemia. Patients with Raynaud\u2019s \ndisease often have chronic paronychia as well as fungal \ninfections involving the nail.\nThe nail changes in systemic sclerosis include erythe -\nma and telangiectasia of the proximal nail fold, splinter \nhemorrhages, ventral ptygerium, and infarcts of the distal \ndigits secondary to ischemia.

In ad -\ndition, the disorder shows granular deposition of im -\nmunoglobulin along the BMZ. Such deposition may be sufficiently intense to give a band-like pattern that can be confused with BP. However, patients with bullous lupus erythematosus histopathologically demonstrate a neutro -\nphilic infiltrate similar to that of dermatitis herpetiformis.\nBullous forms of lichen planus exist that are distin -\nguished by an intense mononuclear infiltrate adjacent to the BMZ, absence of anti-BMZ antibodies, and charac-teristic epidermal changes of lichen planus, which allow differentiation.\nEpidermolysis bullosa of the junctional and dystrophic \ntypes may show a blister at the dermoepidermal junction. Such cases are characterized by onset of blistering early in childhood, absence of the inflammatory infiltrate, and negative direct immunofluorescence. The scarring, pro-gressive nature of these disorders is easily distinguishable clinically.\nPorphyria cutanea tarda also shows pauci-inflammato-\nry subepidermal blistering, which occurs in sun-exposed areas. Histologically, the dermal papillae irregularly ex-tend into the bulla cavity. Direct immunofluorescence microscopy may be positive, further confusing this dif -\nferentiation. The diagnosis of porphyria cutanea tarda is ultimately made on the basis of elevated 24-hour uro -\nporphyrins. Pseudoporphyria related to the use of non -\nsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may give a clinical, pathologic and immunopathologic pattern iden -\ntical to that of porphyria cutanea tarda, but the 24-hour uroporphyrin level is normal. Epidermolysis bullosa ac-quisita is discussed in detail later.\nThe mucous membrane lesions of cicatricial pem -\nphigoid must be differentiated from those of oral lichen \nplanus, erythema multiforme, aphthous stomatitis, Beh -\n\u00e7et\u2019s syndrome, and pemphigus. The differentiation from oral lichen planus and erythema multiforme can usually be made histopathologically. Aphthous stomatitis lesions tend to be small and punched out. Beh\u00e7et\u2019s syndrome need only be considered if other components of the syn -\ndrome, including genital ulceration, pustular dermatosis, and iritis, are present. None of these disorders demon-strates anti-BMZ antibodies.\nPatient Evaluation\nClose examination of all mucosal and cutaneous sur-faces is necessary. Esophageal involvement may pro -\nduce stricture, and patients with esophageal complaints should be considered for endoscopy and possible biopsy.  \nIn the presence of symptoms and/or signs found by the general physical examination that suggest the possibility of internal malignancy, those findings should be evalu -\nated. However, no detailed evaluation to rule out the pos -\nsibility of malignancy is otherwise necessary. Potentially infected lesions should be cultured. Evaluation of the patient\u2019s general status, including CBC, chemistry pro-file, and urinalysis, is advisable because many patients will have associated complicating clinical problems attendant upon their age. Chest X-ray and tuberculosis skin testing should be undertaken prior to starting corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressive therapy.\nInitial study attempts to correlate the titers of BP an -\ntibody with disease activity were unsuccessful. However, it had been observed that the disappearance of antibody from the serum usually heralded the onset of spontaneous remission. Recently an association between disease activ -\nity and antibody titers has been seen when antibody levels to the BPAG2 antigen are followed specifically by highly sensitive ELISA assays.\nTreatment\nThe majority of patients with BP have a complete clini-cal remission following effective therapy. The mainstay of therapy for BP is parenteral corticosteroids. Oral \nprednisone, 40 to 60  mg daily, is generally adequate for \ninitial treatment, and may be the only treatment neces -\nsary. With this agent, individual blisters generally resolve \nwithin 2 to 3  weeks and new blister formation ceases. A \nmajor complication of treatment is related to cortico -\nsteroid side effects, including increased susceptibility to infection, potential gastrointestinal bleeding, onset of diabetes mellitus, and the possible development of psy -\nchiatric symptoms.",

Peripheral blood eosinophils \nare increased in various inflammatory diseases, classi -\ncally in parasitic infections, allergic diseases and drug \nreactions, in hematological malignancies, and in some \nsolid tumors.

Increasing evidence shows that \nursodeoxycholic acid reduces fetal risks associated with \nICP. Cholestyramine (8 to 16 g/day) can improve pruri -\ntus, but it does not improve the biochemical aberrations \nor fetal complications of ICP. Furthermore, patients may \nexperience rebound of pruritus after the first week of \ntreatment. Cholestyramine, which can precipitate vitamin \nK deficiency, should be administered with weekly vitamin \nK supplementation. Limited benefits have been seen with \nepomediol, silymarin, S-adenosyl- 1- methionine, activat -\ned charcoal, dexamethasone, and phenobarbital. Effective \npruritus control with UVB phototherapy has also been \nreported.\nFollowing delivery, pruritus typically resolves within \n48 hours, and laboratory abnormalities resolve within \n2 to 4 weeks.

Pemphigoid gestationis (PG) \nand polymorphic eruption of pregnancy (PEP) are well-\ndefined entities, but the etiopathogenesis of prurigo of \npregnancy (PP) and pruritic folliculitis of pregnancy \n(PFP) is not well understood. Discourse regarding the \nclassification of prurigo of pregnancy and pruritic follicu -\nlitis of pregnancy under the umbrella term \u201catopic erup -\ntion of pregnancy\u201d continues.\nPemphigoid Gestationis\nPemphigoid gestationis (PG, herpes gestationis) is a \nrare, pruritic, autoimmune skin disease of pregnancy and \nthe puerperium and is immunopathologically similar to \nbullous pemphigoid. PG incidence ranges from 1:2000 \nto 1:50,000 pregnancies depending on the frequency of \nHLA-haplotypes DR3 and DR4. PG has also occurred in \nthe setting of trophoblastic tumors (hydatidiform mole, \nchoriocarcinoma). Pathogenic IgG 1 autoantibodies target \nan epitope (NC16A2 or MCW-1) in the noncollagenous \ndomain of the bullous pemphigoid 180-kDa hemides -\nmosomal glycoprotein (BP180) of the dermal\u2013epidermal \njunction leading to tissue disruption and blister forma -\ntion; these autoantibodies have been shown to cross-react \nwith chorionic and amniotic epithelia.\nOnset of PG predominantly occurs in the second and \nthird trimesters although first trimester onset has also \nbeen reported. Ten to 16% of cases begin early postpar -\ntum. Pruritus is prominent and often intense. Urticarial \npapules/plaques may evolve to tense bullae; lesions may \nassume an annular configuration ( Figs 41-1 and 41-2 ). \nCharacteristically, lesions initially involve the perium -\nbilical abdomen and subsequently generalize to the trunk \nand extremities. Acral involvement of palms and soles is typical. The face and mucous membranes are usually \nspared. Scarring only occurs in the setting of excoriation \nor superinfection.\nDiagnosis requires immunologic testing in addition \nto routine histopathology. Direct IF of perilesional skin \nshows linear C3 deposition along the basement mem -\nbrane zone, with demonstrable IgG in only 25% of cases. \nNevertheless, IgG is positive when indirect complement-\nadded IF is performed. In salt-split testing, the antibody \nbinds to the roof of the specimen.

Functionally different wound dressings \nare combined in commercial products (e.g., silver com -\nbined with alginate, collagen with hydrocolloid). The best \ncombinations for exudative wounds are alginates, foams, \nand dry gauze. The best for dry wounds are  hydrogels, \nhydrocolloids, and impregnated gauze.\nLimb Elevation\nControl of edema is extremely important for healing \nvenous ulcerations, and probably to any cause of leg  \nulcerations. This can be achieved primarily through limb \nelevation and compression. The simplest method of leg \nelevation is to get patients off their feet and into bed when \npossible; elevating the affected leg 18 cm above the level \nof the heart for 2 to 4 hours during the day and at night is \nmost effective. If this is not possible, patients should un -\nderstand that the ankle must be elevated higher than the \nlevel of the knee to be of any benefit. Leg elevation should \nbe encouraged in all patients with venous insufficiency, \nunless they have concomitant arterial insufficiency.\nCompression\nCompression is as important as elevation in the man -\nagement of venous ulcerations and should be applied on \narising and maintained at least until bedtime. Raising the \nlocal hydrostatic pressure and reducing the superficial  \nvenous pressure reduce the leak of solutes and fluid into \nthe interstitial space, thus reducing edema. Compression \nalso improves lymphatic drainage, reduces bacterial load, \nand improves fibrinolysis.\nThe optimal pressure of the compression bandaging for \nmost patients without arterial disease is 35 to 40 mm Hg \nand typically is changed weekly unless an excessive amount \nof drainage requires more frequent changes. Methods of \ncompression include support stockings, elastic and non -\nelastic single-layer bandages, multilayer bandages, and  \nintermittent pneumatic compression.\nElastic Support Stockings\nElastic support stockings should be comfortable and may \nbe removed at night and before bathing or sleeping. Their \nmajor disadvantages are inadequate control of drainage, \nand the difficulty of application and removal, particularly \nfor elderly patients. However, stockings with a zipper \nand several similar devices are commercially available to  \nfacilitate the process.\nUnna Boot\nThe Unna boot is an inelastic compression bandage that \nconsists of a zinc-oxide-impregnated gauze wrap that is \napplied from the toes to the knee, covered with a layer of \ncotton, and wrapped with an elastic compression dressing. Given its inelastic nature, it only works in ambulatory pa -\ntients. When correctly applied, however, Unna boots are \nhelpful in treating elderly patients, especially those with \nconcomitant mild arterial insufficiency.\nElastic Multilayer Bandaging Systems\nA Cochrane systematic review determined that com -\npression therapy was more effective than noncompres -\nsive dressings for the treatment of VLUs. Furthermore, \nhigh- compression systems were more effective than low-\ncompression systems. No significant differences in the \neffectiveness of different high-compression systems were \nobserved.\nMultilayered bandage systems additionally provide \ncushioning, have absorptive capacity, and require less \nfrequent dressing changes. However, this system requires \ntrained personnel for adequate application.\nAdjunct Wound Care Techniques\nGrowth Factors\nAnimal models of chronic wounds have shown that growth \nfactors can improve healing, but overall, results from clini -\ncal trials studying growth factors to accelerate wound heal -\ning have been disappointing. To date, the US Food and \nDrug Administration has approved only recombinant \nplatelet-derived growth factor BB (becaplermin, in gel \nform) for adjunct treatment of diabetic neuropathic foot \n ulcerations. However, an available hematopoietic stimulant, \ngranulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, when \nused intralesionally, has shown to improve wound healing \nin VLUs. The main disadvantage that precludes its use is \npain both locally and with the occurrence of bone pain.\nSkin Grafts\nSurgical skin grafts may be beneficial for some patients \nwith recalcitrant ulcerations.",

The lesions begin as red-purple papules \nthat coalesce to form red-yellow plaques ( Fig. 4-6 ). The \nlesions are most prominent over points of trauma, such \nas the elbows, knees, dorsum of the hands, and buttocks. \nSystemic disease is rare. Erythema elevatum diutinum \nis said to be responsive to the antileprosy agent dap -\nsone, whereas most cases of the other cutaneous vas -\nculitides may be less responsive to this drug. The en -\ntity known as BCPAN can present variably in the skin, \nbut most often presents as nodules or ulcers that may \nbe surrounded by livedo reticularis. Although there \nare some authorities who believe that this disease has \nthe potential to progress to classic systemic PAN, the \nmajority of dermatologists who have encountered this \ndisorder have found it not to progress. These patients \nmay have an accompanying neuropathy, fever, and/or \nmalaise, but BCPAN never involves kidneys, lungs, or \ngastrointestinal tract. Biopsy of these lesions reveals in -\nvolvement of arterioles often found in subcutaneous fat. \nTreatment for BCPAN often includes prednisone early \nin the course, which is followed by the use of dapsone, \nmycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, or methotrexate \nas steroid-sparing agents.\nDIAGNOSTIC APPROACH\nSkin biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of CV, and \nthe first step to be carried out. Accurate histological classifi -\ncation is the cornerstone upon which our diagnostic process \nwill be built. For that reason, some important considerations \nabout the biopsy process should be taken into account.A punch or excisional biopsy extending to the sub -\ncutis should be taken from the most tender, reddish or \npurpuric, lesional skin. In ulcerative lesions, the yield of \ndetecting the affected vessel may be increased by includ -\ning the center of the ulcer in the biopsy specimen. When \nbiopsing livedo reticularis, the white center of the circu -\nlar livedo segment should be the focus, as the erythema is \ndue to venous congestion caused by the involved artery.\nThe optimal time for skin biopsy is less than 48 hours \nafter the appearance of a vasculitic lesion. After 24 hours \nneutrophilic infiltration of wall vessels is progressively \nreplaced by lymphocytes and macrophages. In conse -\nquence, lesions older than 48 hours may show a predomi -\nnant lymphocyte infiltrate regardless of the underlying \nform of vasculitis. A direct immunofluorescence analysis \nis also mandatory, since it does not confirm the diagno -\nsis but may guide us in the appropriate direction. Here \n timing is also important. The older the biopsied lesion \nis, the fewer immunoglobulins are found. After 72 hours \nonly C3 is detected .\nA histopathological diagnosis of vasculitis must be \ncorrelated with clinical history (recent drug exposure, \n infections, etc.), physical examination, and laboratory and \nradiological findings in order to establish the presence or \nabsence of systemic involvement. Routine complemen -\ntary examinations should include chest X-ray, complete \nblood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C- \nreactive protein, liver and kidney function test, urinalysis, \nrheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, ANCA, serum \nIgA, cryoglobulins, complement levels (C3, C4), and \n determinations for hepatitis B and C virus.\nIn those patients in whom a suspected well-defined \nentity may explain the presence of CV, specific studies \nshould be considered (HIV and other viral determina -\ntions, blood cultures, echocardiography, colonoscopy, \nrenal biopsy, lumbar puncture, etc.). Figure 4-7  shows a \nwork-up in a patient with CV.\nTREATMENT\nTreatment of SoCSVV is empiric, as large, well- controlled \nstudies are lacking. Nevertheless, SoCSVV is remarkably \npredictable in its rapid and sometimes  complete improve -\nment after bed-rest, and in some cases with low-dose \nprednisone therapy.

Aspirin as monotherapy is helpful in the treatment \nof the fever and arthritis associated with KD, but does \nnot decrease the incidence of coronary artery aneurysms. \nDespite early treatment, 10% to 15% of cases are resis -\ntant to IVIG. A variety of adjuvant therapies have been \nreported in cases refractory to IVIG, including systemic \ncorticosteroids, infliximab, cyclosporine, methotrexate, \nplasmapheresis, and cyclophosphamide.\nEarly data suggested an increased cardiovascular risk \nwhen systemic corticosteroid monotherapy was employed. \nHowever, a more recent study in the Japanese literature \nfound reduction in cardiovascular sequelae when patients \nwere treated with a combination of systemic corticoste -\nroids, IVIG, and aspirin as opposed to IVIG and aspirin \nalone. It is unclear whether these data can be extrapolated \nto affected populations in other parts of the world.\nSJ\u04e6GREN\u2019S SYNDROME\nSj\u04e7gren\u2019s syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune condition that \nprimarily affects the secretory glands leading to xerosto -\nmia and xerophthalmia, often with associated arthritis. \nOther organs can also be affected including the lungs, \nkidneys, neurologic system, and liver. The pathogenesis \nis attributed to abnormal B-cell activation and dysfunc -\ntion within the Th17 pathway.\nSS can be seen as a primary disorder or in the setting of \nother autoimmune conditions. An array of systemic mani -\nfestations may occur including B-cell lymphomas and vas -\nculitis. Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue marginal zone \nlymphoma is the most common associated malignancy and \nis seen in approximately 5% of patients. SS is more common \nin women, particularly presenting in the fourth and fifth \ndecades, although the syndrome has even been reported \nin the pediatric population. Serologic findings include the \npresence of ANA, anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies, RF, and \nhypergammaglobulinemia. To date, the American College \nof Rheumatology and the American-European Consensus \ngroup have differing classifications for the disorder.\nXerosis remains the most frequent skin manifestation \nof SS. In the setting of xerostomia, perleche and thrush \ncan result from yeast overgrowth. Halitosis and dental \ncaries arise with decreased saliva production. Other cu -\ntaneous manifestations include cutaneous small-vessel \nvasculitis presenting as palpable purpura, urticarial vas -\nculitis of the hypo- and normocomplementemic types, \nhypergammaglobulinemic purpura that can result in \nperipheral neuropathy, Raynaud\u2019s disease, amyloidosis, \nSweet\u2019s syndrome, erythema nodosum, and cryoglobuli -\nnemic vasculitis ( Fig. 7-6 ). Cryoglobulinemia, vasculitis, \nhypocomplementemia and parotid swelling are associated \nwith increased lymphoma risk among Sj \u04e7gren\u2019s patients. \nAnnular erythema has been reported primarily in Asian \npopulations and presents with annular plaques with or \nwithout scale on sun-exposed areas of the face and ex -\ntremities that usually occurs in those with seropositiv -\nity to Ro autoantibodies. A recent retrospective review \ndetailed 43 cases in non-Asian patients. Some authors \nsuggest that the photodistributed annular scaly plaques \nseen in annular erythema of Sj \u04e7gren\u2019s strongly resembles \nsubacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus; however, they differ histologically with annular erythema exhibiting \nperivascular and periadnexal cuffing of lymphocytes.\nCurrent treatments for SS are largely aimed at man -\naging symptoms. Emollients are beneficial in repairing \nbarrier function and humidifiers are helpful to combat \nxerosis. Regular ophthalmologic exams are warranted \nas corneal abrasions can occur in the setting of xeroph -\nthalmia. Lubricating drops are the first-line therapy to \ndecrease eyelid friction over the corneal surface. Punctal \nocclusion, topical cyclosporine, and topical tacrolimus are \nalternative treatments. Regular professional dental clean -\nings, home hygiene, salivary stimulants, and diet man -\nagement can prevent loss of teeth.",

In inflammatory metastases, \nthe superficial lymphatics are dilated and plugged with metastatic cells, and there is some surrounding inflam -\nmatory infiltrate. Signet ring cells are frequently seen \nwith  adenocarcinomas of the stomach or gastrointestinal \ntract, but have also been described in bladder carcinoma and melanoma. Lobules of clear-staining cells with gly -\ncogen and highly vascular stroma can be seen with renal cell carcinoma, but clear cells can also originate from other sites, including the liver, lung, and ovary. Meta-static ovarian, thyroid, stomach, and certain lung cancers can also have a papillary pattern.\nEVALUATION AND PROGNOSIS\nIn patients with an unknown primary tumor, a work-up including a complete history and physical examination, review of systems, hematologic and biochemical pro -\nfiles, chest radiography, computed tomography of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, and mammography in wom -\nen may yield helpful information. Cutaneous  metastases  \nare typically a late finding and portend a poor prognosis. \nSkin metastases from colorectal  carcinomas have a bet -\nter prognosis compared to other  carcinomas. Prognosis  \nvaries based on cancer type, but in one study, the av -\nerage survival time of patients with skin metastasis was \n7.5 months.THERAPY\nWhen cutaneous metastases herald the onset of extrano-dal disease in a patient with a known internal malignancy, more aggressive intervention for treatable forms of cancer can be utilized. Solitary nodules can be excised or radi-ated depending on the underlying cancer. Chemotherapy for internal disease may also treat cutaneous metastases and may be more likely to induce a treatment response in certain cancer types.\nSUGGESTED READINGS\nAlcaraz I, Cerroni L , Rutten A , et al.

Lichen planus may be more frequent in patients with \nprimary biliary cirrhosis. Patients also develop jaundice, \nhyperpigmentation, and xanthomas, which are caused by \nthe associated hyperlipidemia. The xanthomas may be strik -\ning and include xanthelasma, planar xanthomas in palmar \ncreases and scars, tuberous xanthomas over the extensor  \naspects of joints and pressure areas, and, rarely, tendinous \nxanthomas ( Fig. 30-6 ). Late in the course of the disease, \npatients may develop osteomalacia (secondary to dimin -\nished absorption of vitamin D), portal hypertension, and \nhepatic failure. Therapy for primary biliary cirrhosis in -\ncludes the use of ursodeoxycholic acid and possibly feno -\nfibrate. There are multiple drugs under investigation for \nprimary biliary cirrhosis including oral budesonide, my -\ncophenolate mofetil, benzafibrate, and obeticholic acid. \nLiver transplantation can be performed when advanced \ncirrhosis is present and death is imminent.\nHEMOCHROMATOSIS\nHemochromatosis, also known as bronze diabetes, is an \nautosomal recessive disease characterized by cutaneous \nhyperpigmentation, diabetes mellitus, and cirrhosis of \nthe liver. There is a basic defect in iron metabolism, re -\nsulting in increased absorption of iron from the intestine \nand deposition of iron in various tissues, particularly the \nskin, liver, heart, pancreas, and endocrine organs. There \nare also secondary forms of hemochromatosis that may \nresult from excessive oral intake of iron, from repeated \ntransfusions in patients with refractory anemia, or from a \ncongenital transferrin deficiency. Unlike in primary bili -\nary cirrhosis, 90% of patients with hemochromatosis are \nmale. The disease usually becomes clinically apparent be -\ntween the ages of 40 and 60 years.\nThe hyperpigmentation is generalized but accentu -\nated in exposed areas ( Fig. 30-7 ). A small percentage \nof patients will develop pigmentation of oral mucous \nmembranes and on the conjunctivae, which is similar to \nthe pattern of pigmentation seen in Addison\u2019s disease. Hyperpigmentation is the presenting manifestation in \none-third of patients, and it is usually a distinctive me -\ntallic gray, although it may be brown. It results from an  \nincrease in melanin in the skin, presumably as a result \nof stimulation of the melanin-producing system by the \nexcessive iron stores. The skin tends to be dry and scaly, \nand patients may develop other changes in the skin, hair, \nand nails identical to those seen with cirrhosis of the liver. \nCommon extracutaneous features include diabetes mel -\nlitus, gonadal deficiency, cardiac disease, and a distinctive \narthropathy with chondrocalcinosis. Unlike many other \nforms of cirrhosis, there is an effective form of therapy for \nsome patients with hemochromatosis, namely, removal of \niron stores by repeated phlebotomy.\nWILSON\u2019S DISEASE\nWilson\u2019s disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) is also \na rare autosomal recessive disease associated with cir -\nrhosis, but its clinical and pathologic manifestations re -\nsult from an excessive accumulation of copper in many \ntissues, especially the brain, liver, corneas, and kidneys. \nThe triad of basal ganglia degeneration, cirrhosis of the \nliver, and a pathognomonic pigmentation of the corneal \nmargins (Kayser\u2013Fleischer ring) is characteristic of the \ndisease. The Kayser\u2013Fleischer ring is a golden-brown or \n greenish-brown circle of pigment produced by the depo -\nsition of copper in Descemet\u2019s membrane at the periph -\nery of the cornea ( Fig. 30-8 A). This ocular finding can \nbe important diagnostically, but the majority of patients \npresent with either neurologic symptoms or hepatic in -\nsufficiency. The prognosis of Wilson\u2019s disease is often \ngrave because of a delay in early diagnosis, which allows \nirreparable damage to be done to the liver and nervous \nsystem.",

Those affected by IGD are most commonly mid -\ndle-aged females, and can have arthritis symptoms prior \nto, concurrent with, or subsequent to development of the \ncutaneous manifestations.\nClinical Manifestations\nIGD typically presents with symmetric erythematous \npapules and plaques, often with an annular configuration, \non the lateral trunk, medial thighs, and buttocks. Occa -\nsionally the lesions can be skin-colored or associated with \nburning or pruritus. The \u201crope sign,\u201d which is character -\nized by linear cords in the aforementioned sites, is con -\nsidered pathognomonic for IGD when present, but has \nonly been seen in 9% of reported cases. The associated \narthritis is described as a seronegative, nonerosive polyar -\nthritis of both the small and large joints. This association \nhas been labeled the \u201cIGD with arthritis syndrome\u201d by \nsome. The closely related entity, IGD drug reaction, is \ntypically not associated with an underlying arthritis, but \ncan resemble IGD clinically. It has been reported with a \nnumber of medications including calcium channel block -\ners, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, statins, \nanti-TNF- \u03b1 therapy, IL-1 inhibitors, furosemide, and \nantihistamines.\nHistopathologic Features\nGiven the polymorphous nature of the cutaneous mani -\nfestations of IGD, histopathologic analysis is needed to \ndetermine the diagnosis. Interstitial palisading histiocytes \nare noted around degenerated collagen, with a surround -\ning dense, bottom-heavy dermal infiltrate comprised of \nneutrophils and eosinophils. There is an absence of asso -\nciated vasculitis. In IGD drug reaction, a vacuolar inter -\nface dermatitis with a prominent infiltrate of eosinophils \nand minimal degenerated collagen is typical. Interstitial \ngranuloma annulare can be difficult to differentiate from \nIGD both clinically and histologically, but classically \nexhibits a \u201ctop heavy,\u201d focal infiltrate with associated \nmucin. A detailed histologic description of PNGD is de -\nscribed below.\nTreatment\nData regarding treatment of IGD are largely limited to \ncase reports and small series. Successful reports of sys -\ntemic and topical corticosteroids, thalidomide, hydroxy -\nchloroquine, TNF antagonists, intravenous immuno -\nglobulin, and tofacitinib exist. A recent review of the \nliterature revealed that two-thirds of patients with IGD \nachieved remission between 3 months and 3 years, while"
